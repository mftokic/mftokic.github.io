Sitting at flower child in Dallas, and the waitress asked if I was ok because I wasn't looking at my phone. 

Too many apps, paying too much money. Always have something on my TV, removing any boredom in my life. Staying in to watch TV versus going out. TV as a form of escaping from life's problems. Added anxiety from news/movies you don't need in your life. Time suck away from other things (alive vs dead time). Books become fun again, especially fiction. When you do watch a movie outside of home, it's amazing (when I watched a movie on a plane).
