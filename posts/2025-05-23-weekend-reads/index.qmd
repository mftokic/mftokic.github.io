### [The Day You Became A Better Writer By Scott Adams](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)

- Removing fluff and keeping your writing simple is key.

### [OpenAI Rolls Out Codex, An Automated Coding Agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/)

- This agent runs autonomously in the cloud to build many new software features in parallel. 
- For the longest time, I've been waiting for LLMs to get so good they can port my forecasting package, [finnts](https://microsoft.github.io/finnts/), from R to Python. I think now I might be able to get that work started. Exciting stuff!

- **Vitamin D**
    - **What it does**: Acts like a hormone, flipping 200+ genes for immune function, mood, and bone strength.
    - **Problem**: Indoor living leaves ~40 % of adults short.
    - **Fix**: Supplement 2 000–4 000 IU of vitamin D₃ daily; pair with vitamin K₂ (≈ 100 µg) so calcium goes to bones, not arteries.
- **Omega 3**
    - **Why care**: Higher blood omega-3 can add years to life, cut triglycerides, and calm inflammation.
    - **Targets**: 1000–2000 mg EPA + DHA daily from fatty fish or purified fish-/algal-oil capsules.
- **Magnesium**
    - **Roles**: Needed for 300+ enzymes, ATP energy, nerve balance, vitamin D activation.
    - **Shortfall**: Nearly half the population under-consumes it.
    - **Dose**: 200–400 mg nightly (glycinate, citrate, or malate). Bonus: deeper sleep, fewer cramps, steadier blood pressure.
- **Triage Theory**
    - Minor shortages get “triaged” to urgent tasks (e.g., keeping blood clotting) while long-term maintenance (DNA repair, artery upkeep) is skipped. You feel fine today but sow seeds of cancer, heart disease, or dementia decades later. 
    - **Solution**: keep every micronutrient in the green zone, not just “barely adequate.”
- **Multivitamins**
    - Over 90 % of people miss at least one essential nutrient from food. A quality multivitamin/mineral fills common gaps safely and cheaply. Urine color doesn’t equal wasted value; it simply shows water-soluble B-vitamins passing through.
- **Personalized Nutrition**
    - Variants in genes like MTHFR (folate), vitamin D receptors, or magnesium transporters can raise your optimal intake. Simple DNA tests plus blood work reveal whether you need more of certain B-vitamins, choline, or others. One-size-fits-all dosing belongs in the last century.
- **Nutrient Synergy**
    - **Magnesium + Vitamin D**: Mg activates D; D can’t perform without it.
    - **Vitamin D + K2**: D boosts calcium absorption; K2 directs calcium to bones.
    - **Food First**: Whole foods pack these combos naturally—e.g., salmon (D + omega-3s), leafy greens (Mg + K), bell peppers (vitamin C aids iron absorption).
- **Phytochemicals** 
    - **Sulforaphane**: From broccoli sprouts; switches on Nrf2, your cell-cleanup master switch. Two servings of sprouts or a 10–20 mg extract a few times weekly can boost detox enzymes and antioxidant defenses.
    - **Anthocyanins**: Blue/purple pigments in berries improve brain blood flow and memory; aim for a daily cup of mixed berries or a concentrated powder.
    - **Rule of Thumb**: “Eat the rainbow” = free daily antioxidant therapy.
- **Processed Foods**
    - Factory foods hijack appetite, spike blood sugar, and displace nutrients. In controlled trials people eat about 500 extra calories a day and gain weight on an ultra-processed diet even when meals are calorie-matched. Swap packaged snacks, sodas, and fast-food for whole-food versions; your waistline, microbiome, and inflammation markers will thank you.
- **VO2 Max**
    - Cardiorespiratory fitness trumps almost every other risk factor. Moving from “poor” to “average” fitness slashes mortality risk as much as quitting smoking. Aim for at least:
        - 150 min/week moderate cardio (or 75 min vigorous), plus
        - 2–3 strength sessions to preserve muscle and bone. Mix in interval training or hiking hills to nudge VO₂ max higher—adaptation happens at every age.

*Harness circadian biology for sharper focus, better mood, and deeper sleep.*

#### Morning (Wake → Noon)

| Tool | Why It Works | How To Do It |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Log Wake-Up Time** | Estimates your **temperature minimum** (≈ 2 h before normal wake time). Later cues best focus window. | Keep pen & pad on the nightstand; jot wake-up time daily. |
| **Walk Outside Immediately** | Forward motion + “optic flow” calms amygdala (lower anxiety) and boosts alertness. | 10–15 min brisk walk — no sunglasses. |
| **Sunlight in Eyes** | Early bright light sets your circadian clock and triggers the healthy cortisol pulse. | Combine with the walk; cloud cover is fine. |
| **Hydrate + Electrolytes** | Neurons fire with sodium, potassium, magnesium; you wake slightly dehydrated. | Big glass of water + pinch sea salt (≈ ½ tsp). |
| **Delay Caffeine 90–120 min** | Prevents mid-afternoon crash from early adenosine blockade. | First coffee/tea after the 90-min mark. |
| **Fast Until Late Morning** | Mild adrenaline bump → tighter focus, better learning. | First calories ~11 a.m.–noon (water/electrolytes only before). |

#### 90-Minute Deep-Work Block
1. **Start 4–6 h after temperature minimum** (usually mid-morning).  
2. **Set a 90-min timer** to ride the brain’s ultradian cycle.  
3. **Optimize workstation:** screen at/above eye level, upright posture, low-volume white noise.  
4. **Phone off** (not airplane mode).  

*Objective: enter a “tunnel” of calm, intense focus.*

#### Midday

| Action | Why | Implementation |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| **Workout** | Exercise boosts BDNF, immune balance, mood. | Alternate: **Resistance** (80 % sub-failure / 20 % to failure) **and** **Endurance** (80 % easy / 20 % above lactate threshold). Keep < 60 min. |
| **First Meal: Protein-Heavy, Lowish Carb** | Maintains dopamine & adrenaline for afternoon alertness. | Protein + veg; add starch only if you trained. |
| **Omega-3 Dose** | 1 g EPA/day supports mood like a mild antidepressant. | Fish, algae oil or capsule with lunch. |
| **Post-Meal Walk (5–30 min)** | Speeds glucose clearance, reinforces light cues. | Step outside immediately after eating. |

#### Afternoon

- **Light Break:** 10–30 min outside. Late-day sun buffers against nighttime light disruption.  
- **Second 90-min Work Block:** Same tunnel protocol during your next alert peak.

#### Evening

| Habit | Purpose | How |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Dinner = Starchy Carbs + Protein** | Carbs → serotonin → melatonin → easier sleep; replenishes glycogen. | Rice, potatoes, pasta, oats, plus moderate protein. |
| **Hot Bath/Sauna (1–2 h Pre-Bed)** | Heats you so the body cools faster afterward, speeding sleep onset. | 10–15 min hot shower, bath, or sauna. |
| **Dark, Cool Bedroom** | Light & heat suppress melatonin. | Black-out curtains; room ≈ 18 °C / 65 °F. |
| **Optional Sleep Stack** | Eases transition without heavy drugs. | 30–60 min pre-bed: 300–400 mg **Mg threonate/glycinate** + 50 mg **apigenin** + 100–200 mg **L-theanine**. |

#### Night-Waking Fixes

| Scenario | Tactic |
|----------|--------|
| Wake 2–3 a.m. after forcing yourself to stay up late | Go to bed earlier; align with natural melatonin wave. |
| Bathroom trips | Keep lights dim, return to bed quickly. |
| Racing mind | 10 slow breaths (exhale 2× inhale) or brief body-scan meditation. |

#### Quick Cheatsheet
- **Wake** → log time → walk + sunlight → water + salt → delay caffeine.  
- **Mid-morning** → 90-min deep-work tunnel.  
- **Late morning** → workout (resistance or endurance).  
- **Noon** → protein-heavy meal, omega-3, post-meal walk.  
- **Afternoon** → sunlight break + second tunnel.  
- **Evening** → carb-rich dinner → hot bath → dark, cool room → optional sleep stack.  
- **Always** → skip large meals before work, hydrate, keep workouts < 1 h, alternate strength & cardio.

> **Master your 24-hour rhythm and everything—focus, mood, energy, sleep—gets easier.**

#### 1. CrossFit’s Fumble & the Fitness Vacuum  
- **Peak to Pit:** CrossFit peaked ~2017-18, then stumbled (leadership scandals, partner dysfunction, poor event ops).  
- **Opportunity Cost:** Its fall opened space for *Hyrox*, boutique studios (F45, Barry’s, Orangetheory) & run-club culture.  
- **Community Matters:** Turning users into *evangelists* is CrossFit’s lost super-power—now fueling newer tribes.

#### 2. WHOOP: Inside the Data Goldmine  
| Metric | Insight from 100k+ users |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Sleep** | Only ~22 % log ≥7 h; consistency beats duration for health. |
| **Global Quirks** | Doha avg. bedtime ≈ 2 a.m.; Ireland tops alcohol intake; Sweden & Finland lead cold plunges. |
| **Activity Trends** | 2023 boom = pickleball (US); 2024 = padel (global). |

- **Partner Pain:** CrossFit labeled “most dysfunctional partner” in 13 yrs of WHOOP collaborations.  
- **New Features:** WHOOP 5.0 offers 14-day battery, blood-pressure trends, AFib screening & “WHOOP Age” health-span score.

#### 3. Mindset & Self-Development  
##### Only-Child Edge  
- Early adult interaction → comfort in big conversations.  
- Lots of solo time → innate inward reflection (helps define “what you truly want”).  

##### Conviction vs. Doubt  
- **Start-up reality:** Years 21-24 were rejection-heavy; conviction in the *idea* carried Ahmed past shaky self-belief.  
- **Separate Identities:** Decouple *company health* from *personal worth*—avoid “chaotic founder” spiral.

##### Failure Philosophy  
- “Failure-porn” is overrated; unique successes teach more.  
- Yet taking *any* lesson (success or fail) expands resilience & emotional range.

#### 4. Performance Playbook  
| Domain | Ahmed’s Go-To Protocols |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Morning Routine** | Wake → trainer workout → sauna → cold plunge → meditation → protein breakfast. |
| **Travel** | Fast during flights; hydrate with hydrogen-infused water; slam electrolytes; align immediately to destination bedtime—no naps. |
| **Jet Lag Mindset** | Much of it is psychological; stay positive, avoid alcohol & erratic sleep. |

#### 5. Recovery, Sleep & Tech  
- **Hide the Numbers:** WHOOP offers a toggle to *collect* but not *display* sleep & recovery scores—avoids “data anxiety.”  
- **Combating Apnea:** Breath-training tools (e.g., 15 min/day resisted-exhale devices) mimic wind-instrument benefits.  
- **Hydrogen Water Wave:** Portable H₂ flasks (e.g., Echo Go) and even hydrogen baths are emerging performance aids.

#### 6. Ambition, Gratitude & Cost  
- Desire the **lifestyle**, not just the outcome (James Clear).  
- High achievers (Rory McIlroy, Ronaldo, Phelps) trade normalcy for relentless intensity—admire *and* audit the price.  
- Blend **drive (dopamine)** with **gratitude (serotonin)** to avoid “miserable successes.”

#### 7. Practical Nuggets  
- **Don’t eat on planes**—fasting smooths circadian realignment.  
- **Electrolytes + H₂O** > airplane food.  
- **Seek recurring fleeting thoughts** to discover genuine goals.  
- **State goals publicly, work hard consistently, embrace rejection**—luck will find you.  
- **Limit simultaneous desires**; pick one or two lanes to go “all-in.”

#### 8. What’s Next for Will Ahmed & WHOOP  
- Scale new health-span, BP, and heart-screening features.  
- Prep for an eventual IPO.  
- Navigate new-dad life while keeping the morning ritual intact.

> **Bottom Line:** Master your data without becoming its slave; match relentless curiosity with equal parts gratitude—then build, recover, repeat.
