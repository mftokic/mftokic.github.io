        - Don't touch paper twice: You can only keep so many "open tabs" in your head. Make decisions and work on things only once, don't keep them all running in your head constantly.    
        - I'm leaving this with you: Bring problems for employees to solve and get the hell out of the way. Don't let them bring the monkey and place it on your back again.

        - You should aim to produce things at about a 1:10 ratio to how much you consume them. This is true of food, videos, internet comments and parties.
        - Consider deleting as often as you consider adding. This holds true for code, furniture and obligations.
