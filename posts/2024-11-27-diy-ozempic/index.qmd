*I'm not a doctor, I don't play one on TV. This is not health advice. Make your own damn decisions.*

It's the day before Thanksgiving. Or as I like to think of it, the day before the month+ holiday eating binge. While it truly is the most wonderful time of the year to eat, it's not the most healthy. I think everything should be moderation, including moderation. So I like to go nuts myself during this time of year and eat whatever. For most American's though, going nuts on food for a month straight is not a good idea. Most are obese, and have been that way for decades. 

Thankfully new weight loss medicines like Ozempic have risen in popularity over the last few years. These drugs contain a hormone called GLP-1. Which is something your body produces naturally. It's what makes you feel full after eating a meal. If your body consumes this hormone from Ozempic, it will naturally make you feel full quicker. Which makes you less hungry. Which makes you eat less. Causing you to lose weight. Seems like a miracle drug right! Unfortunately [there are no free lunches](https://tim.blog/2024/02/02/no-biological-free-lunches/) in the world of biology. It always comes with a catch. For drugs like Ozempic the catch has to do with it's price ($1,000 a month) and [potential impact on major organs](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/ozempic-side-effects#long-term-side-effects) like your thyroid, pancreas, and heart. But if you're 100 pounds overweight, your organs are already suffering, so taking the drug knowing the tradeoffs is probably worth the risk. Being overweight is bad, mmmk? 

The rise in these drugs has definitely caught my attention, so I've been studying them closer. They have the potential to not just make people more healthy, but their downstream impacts can be enormous. Planes may not need as much fuel on flights, because people onboard will weigh less. McDonald's stock might drop 50% because people aren't impulsively buying milkshakes after work each day. Even gyms could close down, because people can now look good while only taking a pill/shot versus doing 45 min on the stairmaster every day. There will be countless effects. Both good and bad. 

What if you could get all of the good effects from Ozempic without having to pay an arm and a leg while also avoiding the harmful side effects? I think I've come across a combination that will naturally produce more GLP-1 in your body, while also being 1/10th the price of Ozempic. Here is the stack. 

1. [Prebiotic Shakes by Supergut](https://www.amazon.com/Supergut-Prebiotic-Replacement-Strawberry-servings/dp/B0C645Q2CT/ref=sr_1_4_pp?crid=23XDI3ALKQLWE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ftkuxSBzIaWukfVtnXPvZqBYlET7P_DPpqUuEN5VnUiOlBxfOMzcgkMiL86iJAQ0GeA0vssfvxntIN3Y-jpq2Jr_foimcrO1orPTmc26vPj0zWYqPcTnejj0MwKQICLXWiwlEJSfJtTbo5Q2ENGCwCDK4rtNaAjM9UFz9e_ZJNsryI19XvCxIOYsn05ghGOoAHhr4dXeYIZOebY6ufrQyjSfcTU86deki-ovxQBnhDJTQFcD9aEjuI9cMrhEkIUFg-tKC7DY1nrwm6puUBFgl8nXXy17KZ_zWO8J3keUr8A.RYEHioYWLX2J2QAdYpL0AlnSLvNF7ys-Tw_dT4tW3QA&dib_tag=se&keywords=supergut&qid=1732722580&s=hpc&sprefix=supergut%2Chpc%2C177&sr=1-4)
2. [GLP-1 Probiotic by Pendulum](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY3VZDYP?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_8&amp=&crid=2T0LC4RNRX9EX&amp=&sprefix=pendulum)

I've written about Supergut in a [previous post](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-15-hacking-blood-sugar/). It's a fiber supplement that contains prebiotic fiber that has been proven to stimulate the release of GLP-1 in your gut. Pendulum is a company specializing in supplements for your gut microbiome. Their GLP-1 probiotic contains living bacteria that creates the precursors to GLP-1. I first learned about Pendulum from [Kevin Rose](https://www.kevinrose.com/p/a-natural-alternative-to-glp-1-drugs), and the science behind it looks legit. 

I think the combination of both could be a game changer. The prebiotic fiber from Supergut will help give your microbiome the food it needs to thrive. And the probiotics from Pendulum will help develop the right strains of bacteria in your gut that help produce more GLP-1. This one two punch could be very powerful. I don't think they've been studied in combination before, so this could definitely be some bro science, but my research so far tells me it's a good combination. 

These two products combined cost around $100 a month, compared to $1,000 for Ozempic. So you don't have much to lose by trying these products. At a minumum your bathroom visits will become 10x more productive and your microbiome will be better off. Why not try it and see how it might help you fight the good fight during this upcoming season of countless food temptations?
