### Your Data is so Trendy

Every single time series you have ever seen has a trend and seasonality. If they don't, then they are random white noise. A trend is just values steadily rising or falling over time. You could have a rising trend in some years, then a falling trend in others. Below is a chart with a strong trend but weak seasonality.

Seasonality just means that your data has a recurring seasonal pattern. For example your data could spike during the holiday season from Oct-Dec, then fall drastically from Jan-Jun. Your seasonality could also change over time. Below is a chart with strong seasonality but weak trend.

### Breaking Out Trend and seasonality

We can isolate the trend component of a time series using simple methods like moving averages. 

Moving averages. Additive and multiplicative decomposition.
