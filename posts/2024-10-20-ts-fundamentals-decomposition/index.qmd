*This post is part of the [exploratory data analysis chapter](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-10-03-ts-fundamentals-eda/) within a larger learning series around time series forecasting fundamentals. [Check out the main learning path](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-09-25-ts-fundamentals/) to see other posts in the series.* 

The example data used in this series [can be found here.](https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-10-02-ts-fundamentals-whats-a-time-series/example_ts_data.csv) 

### Your Data is so Trendy

Every single time series you have ever seen has a trend and seasonality. If they don't, then they are random white noise. A trend is just values steadily rising or falling over time. You could have a rising trend in some years, then a falling trend in others. Below is a chart with a strong trend but weak seasonality.

Seasonality just means that your data has a recurring seasonal pattern. For example your data could spike during the holiday season from Oct-Dec, then fall drastically from Jan-Jun. Your seasonality could also change over time. Below is a chart with strong seasonality but weak trend.

### Breaking Out Trend and Seasonality with Additive Decomposition

We can isolate the trend component of a time series using simple methods like moving averages (MA). These are just simple averages over a span of time. Let's take a time series from our example revenue data and create a moving average. In the first chart below we used a [2x12-MA](https://otexts.com/fpp3/moving-averages.html#estimating-the-trend-cycle-with-seasonal-data). This moving average now isolates the trend of the time series. We can see a dip in trend around 2020 then a strong rebound going forward. The moving average doesn't start and end at the same time as our time series, since we need a burn in period to start creating the averages. If we wanted to detrend the time series we can subtract the new trend series from our original revenue, shown in the second chart below.

Next we can get the seasonal component of our data. This is very straightforward. All we have to do is take our detrended series and calculate the average revenue for each month of the year. 

Finally we can get the final piece of our decomposition, the remainder series.
