### A Man Must Have a Code

### Bias for Action

Action is the best answer to most problems. Sitting around waiting for something to happen to you rarely never works out. No one ever get's lucky sitting on their couch watching Netflix. Action creates luck, creates feedback, and also creates momentum. 

### Sense of Urgency

Life is short, and timelines are negotiable. Ever heard of the parkinson principle? It states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Got an important work project due in a month? It will probably take you a month to do. Does the same project need to be done by Friday? Then you will also probably finish it Friday morning. 

Reality is negotiable. Peter Thiel has a saying: "If you have a 10 year plan of how to get somewhere, you should ask: why can't I do this in 6 months?". The quality of your questions determines the quality of your life. 

Combining a sense of urgency with a bias for action, you become an unstoppable force. 

### High Agency

Who would you call to break you out of a third world prison? That person has a high sense of agency, which means they have have the ability to control what happens to them in life. Think of it as the opposite of a victim mentality. Agency is the combination of a bias for action with a sense of urgency. 

George Mack does a good job discussing agency. [Here is a good twitter thread example](https://x.com/george__mack/status/1661426260327759902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1661426260327759902%7Ctwgr%5E7eacc97032d4e2d008f3d1d669bb67c347937b2c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.beehiiv.com%2Flogin%3F_gl%3D11bn3wdj_gaNTI1OTM1NjEuMTY4NjMyNDQzMg.._ga_E6Y4WLQ2ECMTY4NjMyNDQzMi4xLjAuMTY4NjMyNDQzMi42MC4wLjA.&utm_source=clouds-and-dirt.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=lindy-library-the-0-1-of-ideas-i-ve-found). 

### Zero Expectations

When Charlie Munger was once asked about what it takes to live a happy life his response was simple, have low expectations. In a similar vein, Naval Ravikant states that happiness is a simple equation. Happiness = Reality - Expectations. 

If you came to Seattle in January and expected it to be warm and sunny, you'd be bummed out if it was 50 degrees with a slight drizzle. Instead if you came expecting it to be cold and constantly raining, then you'd be pleasantly surprised to find out that it didn't rain much at all. The same external events happened in both examples, but the change in expectations made for a better outcome. 

It's ok to have high expectations for yourself, but having high expectations over things in life you can't control is a recipe for disaster. 

### Time Over Money

Control over how you spend your time is the ultimate freedom. It's the life razor I use to make most decisions in my life.

### What Would You Do If You Couldn't Fail?

### What Makes for the Best Story?

### Don't Be the Best, Be the Only

### Did I Always Do My Best?

### Stop Trying to Sound Smart

### Hard Choices, Easy Life. Easy Choices, Hard Life.

### Gear Over Stuff 

### Avoid Scarcity Loops

### The Most Important Question

### Final Thoughts
