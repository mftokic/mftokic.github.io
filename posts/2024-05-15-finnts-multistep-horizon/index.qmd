### TLDR

I'm excited to announce that we just released a new feature in our machine learning forecast package, [finnts](https://microsoft.github.io/finnts/index.html), centered around multistep horizon forecasting. It's a mouthful to say but at a high level it helps improve forecast accuracy by optimizing models to be accurate at each period of a forecast horizon. For example, a 3 month forecast would then be optimized for the forecast in each month (period) of the future forecast. 

Let's dive in to how multivariate modeling used to work in the package and how multistep horizon forecasting can help. 

### How It Used to Work

Let's use an example of a monthly revenue forecast for our business's main product. 

| Date       | Revenue |
|------------|---------|
| 2023-01-01 | 120     |
| 2023-02-01 | 135     |
| 2023-03-01 | 140     |
| 2023-04-01 | 145     |
| 2023-05-01 | 150     |
| 2023-06-01 | 155     |
| 2023-07-01 | 160     |
| 2023-08-01 | 165     |
| 2023-09-01 | 170     |
| 2023-10-01 | 175     |
| 2023-11-01 | 180     |
| 2023-12-01 | 185     |

If we wanted to forecast the next 3 months of revenue using multivariate machine learning models we would have to do some [feature engineering](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-05-01-time-series-features/) to get our data in good shape. This involves creating lags on our <span title="This is the helper text that provides more information about the word.">target variable</span>.
