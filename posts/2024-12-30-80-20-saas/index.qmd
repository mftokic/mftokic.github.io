There's an argument floating around saying that AI will be the death of software as a service (SaaS) companies. These companies make applications you access through the browser on your computer or an app on your phone. Most software you interact with today can be thought of as SaaS. The thinking is that AI will enable companies to build their own tools fast and cheap, instead of buying the same sort of functionality from a SaaS provider. AI can write the code alongside one or two developers, shrinking costs while still getting most of the functionality. I think this is a solid idea, but I'm not sure it's the best approach. Instead I believe SaaS like companies should build 80% of the features needed in the core product, then allow users to augment the product through AI. Let's walk through this with an example. 

Every company has a customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps them work with outside customers. These are products like Salesforce, Dynamics, and many others. some of these products charge by seat, or by user, so this can add up to a lot of costs for a large sales staff. A company may want to build their own internal version of a CRM by using AI and a few developers. They think they might be able to get most of the same functionality for 50% the cost, they could even tailor the software more towards their specific business needs. This is great in theory, but poor in execution. 

Should every company build a CRM system from scratch using AI? Probably not. Starting from zero is not fun and takes a lot of activation energy to get something off the ground and into production. A better way could be if the company could take a bare bones CRM off the shelf, that might have 80% of the features they need, then use AI to customize the final 20% of features to fit their specific business needs. 

This 80/20 approach helps both SaaS providers and customers. The bare bones version could be dirt cheap, and serve as a foundation to build more complex things on top of. The SaaS provider can keep their dev team small, since they only have to build and maintain a core set of features that are not likely to change. This allows them to charge cheaper prices and be more agile. Then the customer can take that core product off the shelf and add features to it. Ideally the SaaS could have a built in AI feature where the customer could ask for new features, and the AI builds it for them into the SaaS product they use. All without bringing in developers. That way customers can get everything they want without the SaaS provider succumbing to feature creep, where by trying to satisfy every customer you end of satisfying none. Right now SaaS product makers have to build potentially thousands of features to meet the needs of thousands of customers. There needs to be a better way. 

The SaaS company now owns a platform. Which contains the core product offering, then thousands of branches of one off product versions that are requested by different customers. They can charge a monthly flat rate for the core product, then an additional charge for every new feature requested and built by AI for each specific customer. Maintaining this kind of evolving platform is complex but removing that complexity away from customers is why customers give money to these companies. Whoever figures out this business model is set to thrive in the upcoming AI future. The crazy part is that this kind of business model can only be created by startups. Since companies like Salesforce cannot burn their existing product to the ground and rebuild using this approach. They already have thousands of features that customers depend on, so they will continue to need thousands of developers to maintain and add to it. The future of SaaS will be won by new products, customized with AI, and most likely from new startups.
