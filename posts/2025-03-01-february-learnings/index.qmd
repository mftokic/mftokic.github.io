I love reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, you name it. Anything learning related is my jam. But I realized that if I don't take notes on what I'm learning, I will probably forget everything. Now when I hear something interesting, I write it down in an Apple note for that month. Below are some of the learnings I jotted down in February, summarized by ChatGPT with additional context added by their new deep research feature. I hope you find them as interesting as I did. 

## AI & Machine Learning  

### Knowledge Distillation  
- **AI Distillation:** Process of transferring knowledge from a large, complex AI model (teacher) to a smaller, efficient model (student). Example: DeepSeek training their R1 model using GPT-4 answers as training data.

### Large Language Model (LLM) Architectures  
- **Transformer Architecture:** Neural network architecture characterized by self-attention mechanisms, enabling parallel processing and context awareness.
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** Architecture where subsets of neurons ("experts") activate selectively per task, significantly reducing computational overhead and inference costs.

### Economics of AI  
- **Jevons Paradox:** Lowering the cost of AI increases its usage dramatically.
- **Token Costs:** Input tokens (~¼ the cost of output tokens) allow parallel processing, whereas output tokens are sequential and auto-regressive.
- **GPU Performance Factors:** Critical aspects for AI training and inference are Floating-point operations (FLOPS), Memory bandwidth (IO), and Chip interconnectedness.
- **Cost Evolution of AI Models:** GPT-3 costs dropped drastically from ~$60 to ~$0.05 per million tokens between 2022 and 2024, a 1,200x reduction.

### Geopolitics and AI Chips  
- Chinese companies circumvent U.S. Nvidia GPU export bans by routing purchases through third-party vendors in Singapore.
- **DeepSeek Origin:** Began as a spinoff of the Chinese hedge fund "High Flyer," originally focused on GPU-based trading algorithms, later pivoting to AI models.

## Cognitive & Performance Optimization  

### Most Important Question (MIQ) Framework  
- Regularly clarify and revisit the single most critical, high-level question guiding your decisions, ensuring deep strategic alignment.

### Peak Performance Work Strategies  
- Optimize intense, focused effort for fewer hours (3–5 hours/day) rather than prolonged mediocre sessions.
- Reserve creative, high-focus tasks for peak-energy periods; routine tasks during lower-energy periods (e.g., noted dip around 2:30–3:30 pm).

### Mental State Management  
- Leverage breathing techniques to control adrenaline and enhance decision-making speed and clarity.
- Prioritize reflective time by avoiding immediate stimuli (e.g., smartphones) first thing in the morning.

### Quality Over Quantity  
- Short bursts of deep work significantly outperform extended hours of moderate or distracted effort.

## Health & Fitness  

### Training Principles  
- **Optimal Training Splits:** "Push-Legs-Pull" split recommended for optimal muscle recovery and growth.
- Aim to train each muscle group twice weekly for maximal growth stimulus.
- Understand the **interference effect**—heavy back workouts might negatively impact squatting performance the next day.

### Protein Intake Recommendations  
- Non-lifters: ~0.8 grams per pound of body weight daily.
- Lifters aiming for muscle growth: ~1.3 grams per pound daily; significant growth benefit compared to lower intakes.

### Effective Supplements for Muscle Gain  
- Creatine (improves strength and power), Protein powder (supports muscle recovery), Multivitamins (general health), Carb powders (Gatorade, Powerade for energy replenishment), Caffeine (enhances workout focus).

### Risks of Sedentary Behavior  
- Prolonged sitting significantly increases mortality risk; offset by regular activity and frequent movement breaks.

### Behavioral Eating Habit Adjustment  
- When stressed or craving food, first take a 30-minute walk to distinguish genuine hunger from stress-induced urges.

## Business & Strategy  

### New Product Strategy  
- Start by identifying core insights, fire small "test" bullets (low-risk experiments), and upon success, scale with larger, well-resourced "cannonballs."

### Market Psychology  
- **Osborn Effect:** Announcing future products too early can stall current sales as customers delay purchasing decisions.
- **Halo Effect:** Successfully launching a new product enhances brand image, positively affecting the sales of existing products.

### Strategic Hiring & Expert Filtering  
- Identify talent by querying top performers for recommendations, refining the hiring funnel to focus on demonstrated capability and peer recognition.

### Economic Insights  
- **GDP Growth Simplified:** Driven by the productivity per worker and the total workforce.
- **Idiot Index:** Metric comparing raw material costs to finished product price, highlighting operational inefficiencies and pricing strategies.

## Historical & Cultural Insights  

### Mongol Empire  
- Exceptional warfare tactics: mobility, psychological intimidation, and merit-based leadership. Each soldier crafted their own bows, ensuring skill and accountability.
- Mongol rule lasted until Soviet invasion (~1220–1920), marking the longest family-led empire in history.
- Genghis Khan’s aggressive strategies rooted partly in personal revenge and necessity after familial trauma.

### Korean Language Origins (Hangul)  
- Hangul invented explicitly due to difficulty in learning complex Chinese characters. Designed for rapid acquisition, enhancing widespread literacy.

### Stanford’s "Touchy-Feely" Class  
- "Interpersonal Dynamics" at Stanford GSB teaches emotional intelligence, authentic communication, and relationship-building skills via experiential T-group sessions.
- 5 levels of communication
    1. Ritual: classic conversations like general greeting
    2. Extended ritual: asking about the weather or a recent sports game
    3. Content: facts about a project or work items
    4. Emotional self-disclosure: saying how you feel emotionally (I feel sad)
    5. Neutral emotional self-disclosure: expressing emotion at another person (I feel proud of you, angry at you, etc)
- To have strong relationships in life and career, you have to get to level 4 and 5

## Psychology & Behavioral Science  

### Behavioral Loops & Addiction  
- **Scarcity Loop:** Opportunity → Unpredictable reward → Quick repeatability drives addictive behaviors (gambling, social media).
- **Near-Miss Effect:** Close failures in gambling or gaming increase dopamine and repeat behaviors, driving addiction.

### Importance of Courage  
- Courage is central to achieving significant outcomes; talent and intelligence without courage lead to stagnation and regret.

### Nova Effect  
- Sudden positive events (e.g., winning the lottery) can negatively impact perceived happiness afterward. Gradual progress allows better psychological adaptation.

## Miscellaneous Insights & Notable Quotes  

### Philosophical Reflections  
- **Success & Failure:** “Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.”
- **Life Razor (Personal Decision Framework):** Prioritize actions granting maximum control over personal time.
- **Seasons of Life:** Life priorities shift naturally through different life stages; adaptability is crucial.
- **Learning & Reflection:** True learning arises when experience intersects with thoughtful reflection.

### Intriguing Observations  
- Diamonds priced disproportionately at milestone sizes (2-carat vs. 1.99-carat).
- Chronic strep throat indicates potential mold exposure.
- Epstein-Barr virus (mono) infection necessary precursor for multiple sclerosis.
- Icelandic dating app created by the government prevents accidental familial relationships.
- Drug companies advertise heavily on news networks, indirectly shaping media narratives.

### Notable Quotes  
- *"Your life is in your hands; don't drop it."* 
- *"The generation that lights the fuse usually gets buried in the rubble."*
- *"Be interested, not interesting."*  
- *"If more money wouldn’t change how you spend your time, you're already rich."*  
- *"Your health at age 80 is a reflection of your relationships at age 50."*
