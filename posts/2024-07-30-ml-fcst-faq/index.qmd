Over the last few years I've presented to hundreds of people outside of Microsoft around how we approach machine learning (ML) forecasting within Microsoft finance. A lot of great questions were asked during those conversations. With many overlaps around common themes. In this post I want to highlight some of the most commonly asked questions and my take on answering them. Hopefully this can be a quick reference for anyone ML curious or want to deepen the ML work being done on their teams. Use the table of contents to skip around to the sections you're most interested in. If there are any topics missing please reach out to me and I will continue to update this post.

## Data {#data}

### Getting high quality historical data {#historical-data}

[Garbage in, garbage out](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-04-08-time-series-garbage/). That's probably the most common saying in the world of ML. If you cannot get high quality historical data, then there is no easy way to produce an accurate ML forecast. You can't work your way around noisy or incomplete data. If your data is messy, hard to find, and comes from 10 different systems, then ML is not something you should be worried about. Fix your data first, then focus on using that data in combination with other things like ML. A nice bow on top of a pile of crap is still a pile of crap. Fix your data first, then focus on ML after.

### Using third party data {#third-party-data}

Your company's business is most likely impacted by greater market forces outside of your control. For example the health of the economy or how much money customers have to spend. Adding data from outside of your company (third party data) as features in your ML models is a good way to improve forecast accuracy, while also being able to describe what outside forces impact your business the most. Some data is freely available, while others have to be paid for. What data you use is up to your domain knowledge of your business.
