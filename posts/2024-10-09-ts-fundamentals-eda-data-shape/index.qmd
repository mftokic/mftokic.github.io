### Initial Data Smell Test

The first step of exploratory data analysis for time series is getting a feel for the data at a high level. This doesn't involve complex statistical analysis. Just simple charts to see how things look. When analyzing these charts we'll use the most underrated concept in machine learning. The human smell test. This involves using your eye balls to look at the data and understand what could be going on based on your domain experience about the area the data tries to explain. Let's chart the time series in a few ways and give it a smell test.

Looking at the data all up shows a pretty stable upward trend with a few bumps in the data. Right now it's hard to tell if those bumps in 2019 and 2021 are outliers or not. We would have to dig deeper into the data. The trend seems to be growing exponentially. Meaning it's not a straight line but instead one that seems to grow faster each year. This kind of hockey stick growth is what all businesses aspire to. Lastly it's hard to tell if there is any strong seasonality.

Breaking out the data by each country is now giving us a better picture of what's going on in our monthly sales. Canada is the country with the exponential growth, combined with a few spikes in some months. These spikes could be one off events that are unpredictable, or something happened in those months that can be quantified in data. 

Revenue in the United States has more of a linear upward trend with strong seasonality. There is something strange going on in 2020 though.

Looking at revenue by product tells a similar story as revenue by country. Cookie sales seem to be a lot more bumpier than ice cream, which is more stable and growing fast.

Finally we can view each time series individually. Our initial hunches at higher aggregations are now confirmed. We can see Canada cookie sales have those crazy spikes. After talking to our sales and marketing teams, we learn that the spikes are caused by new cookie product launches. Ice cream sales in Canada is the one series with the exponential growth.
