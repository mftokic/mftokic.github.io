### Opening Thoughts

Shaan Puri is an entrepreneur and content creator known for his work in the tech industry and his popular podcast "My First Million." He has been involved in various startups and business ventures and is recognized for his insights into entrepreneurship, technology, and business strategy. A few months ago he was on the also popular "How I Write" podcast. While on the show he blew my mind with tons of great ideas around storytelling. I learned a ton and wanted to show the best ideas here. Check them out below! [Also here is a link to the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2BnqYArwaw&list=PLrxUIdme2aVnB6z5BwgIJx0rJjKrl7Qlc&index=12). 

### Binge Bank

If someone wanted to learn more about you, what would they do? Maybe they are a recruiter, trying to offer you the perfect job. Maybe they're an entrepreneur trying to find their next co-founder. Or maybe it's a cute girl you're about to have dinner with. Chances are the only things they can find on you is your social media presence, and hopefully not any mugshots. 

Shaan recommends creating a binge bank for yourself. Where in one hour someone's opinion of you will drastically grow. Think of it as a bank of content that someone can go down the rabbit hole on you. Blogs, videos, newsclippings. Whatever content that gives someone all access pass to how your brain works and who you are as a person. This binge bank can become more powerful than a resume, because it shows your true self, while also showcasing how you communicate. 

After hearing this I started to curate my own binge bank. I added a [Start Here](https://mftokic.github.io/start_here.html) section to my personal site. On this page I have links to posts that best describe me and my capabilities. Right now it's small but one day I hope to grow it to the binge banks of people like [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/best-articles/), [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/new-start-here/), or [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/articles). 

Signature stories. 

- Origin Story 

### Aaron Sorkin's 30 Second Masterclass

> "I worship at the alter of intention and obstacle."
> 
> — Aaron Sorkin

Aaron Sorkin is a famous screenwriter. Creating hits like the TV show "The West Wing" or movies like "The Social Network". When asked about storytelling. His simple advice was that every story needs to have a clear intention and obstacle. 

In any story the main character has a have a clear intention. What do they want? Why do they want it? After that you need an obstacle. Who or what is trying to stop them from getting their intention? It's fundamental to every story, but doesn't have to be life and death. Every movie you have ever seen has this. If it didn't you probably hated the movie. 

### Adding Humor in Storytelling

> "Comedy is a low status game."

Humor is the sauce but not the meal. All humor is just surprise. If you see the puch line coming it's not very funny. 

### Hooks vs Frames

Everyone has seen Twitter/X threads that start with something like "The unbelievable story of xyz person doing xyz thing". It's maximum clickbait and makes me cringe every time I see it. These are tactics that try to hook a reader into continuing to engage in the content. Instead of creating hooks, Shaan recommends creating the right frame for a story. 

A good example of framing is a popular X thread Shaan wrote about an audio streaming app called Clubhouse.

Wrote more of a story than just facts. 

Chappelle story around quitting his show and why he got mad Netflix is streaming the show. He was able to tell a story to convince Netflix to take his show off the app. 

### Tell 100 Stories

Intelligent reps. Improve each time. That's Mr. Beast's advice on making good videos. Make 100 videos, and each time do one thing better than the last time. Either no one ever does the advice, or if they did they never reach out again because they figured it out. In the end it's the perfect advice. 

### Storyworthy Book

Every great story needs stakes. Make clear what's at stake if they don't get their intention. Doesn't have to be high stakes. No one cares about your vacation story or frat party. Stakes come from the emotion. Story is a five second moment of change. Everything comes up to one moment where a thing is transformed. Movies like rom coms are always the exact opposite of the start, having a strong transformation. 

### OTher notes

A story is not a record of what happened. Story is a change, a transformation. At the start it was this way, then there was change and here's how it ended. Only discuss the change. 

Work backwards from the emotion. We only stop to consume something if it creates some sort of emotion. Making videos go viral. Viral means how many people share what you created. Only things people will share is content that makes people laugh, surprise, interesting, blow your mind, get sad, get mad, nostalgic. Start with the desired reaction they want then create the content based on the emotion.  

Understand your audience and the state of mind they are in. You are writing to one person at a time. Debby at her desk, sally in her bed scrolling twitter. 

Miss Excel gets herself into a peak state of mind. Only works on her energy first, then works on creating content second. Once the idea comes she hits record immediately. She believes all content is an energy transfer from herself to her phone. Writers should be more like performers. Where you have a warm up routine to get you psyched up and ready to create content. Write when you get inspired. 

Get your mind right with state changes. First is change in your physiology, do jumping jack, wind sprint to get your body changed. Tony Robbins does this with changing his body temp, either super warm or super cold. It's the fastest way to change how you feel. Second is change in your focus. Second is the story you tell yourself. 

Excitement is the engine and the rudder. Only do things you are excited about. It powers you to keep working hard and also steers you in the right direction to what you're destined to be in life. 

1-2-3 rule of interestingness. Tell me one thing that's interesting I'll say oh wow that's interesting. Tell me two things, Ill say those are interesting. Tell me three interesting things and I'll say you're interesting. 

People will follow you to the ends of the earth if you can give them a feeling more consistently than anyone else. How ppl feel after they hear your story is the end goal.
