- AI Agent will be a ds headcount right out of the box. 
- Agents fix the scaling issue of ds in finance, truly democratizing. 
- Instead of teaching regular people to use self-serve AI tools, agents will teach regular people about ML

- Workflows
    - Data Formatting
    - Research
    - EDA 
        - Data profiling
        - Autocorrelation
        - Missing Values, Outliers
        - Changepoints 
        - Xreg Analysis 
        - Hierarchies
        - Multiple seasonal periods
    - Forecast Iteration
        - Global first, local second
        - data cleaning order 
            - missing values, outliers, boxcox
        - bottoms up first, hierarchical second 
        - univariate first, multivariate second 
            - univariate: baseline models (arima, ets, meanf, snaive, stlm-arima, tbats), data cleaning, seasonal periods, all univariate models
            - multivariate: baseline models (xgboost, glmnet) with defaults, data cleaning (global models), multistep, target features, xregs features, feature selection, all multivariate models
        - Features to adjust in order 
            - Target: lags, rolling window 
            - Xregs: lags 
    - Forecast Update
        - Take last best inputs and create updated future forecast and historical back test 
        - Option to retrain model or use last trained model
    - Forecast Analysis
        - Analyze back test accuracy and future forecast results
        - Determine if forecasts pass various thresholds, either default or set by user 
            - Growth rates, large/small forecasts 
        - If updated forecast does not pass accuracy thresholds or previous best runs, restart forecast iteration process
        - Initial and secondary accuracy metrics. For example if first threshold of 2% weighted MAPE is met then check for a MAE secondary metric. 
    - Forecast Scenarios
        - Run various what if scenarios defined by the user, leveraging the forecast update workflow
    - Forecast Transformation
        - Apply any specific post ML transformations. For example custom allocations down to lower level of data. 
    - Forecast Explanation
        - Explain the forecast output, data used to train models.
        - Teach the user more about how the ML process works, and the reasoning behind model choices. 
    - Variance Analysis
    - Ad Hoc Data Analysis
        - Create and run code to answer any other questions asked by user.
