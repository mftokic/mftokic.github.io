For the first time in history, the answer to the following questions of "what item would you bring to a desert island" and "what item would you keep to start civilization over from scratch" is now the same thing. You would bring ChatGPT, or put more generally a large language model (llm) or broader generative AI model. These AI models condense the knowledge of the data it was trained on. It can acquire knowledge and know how to apply it, this is the definition of intelligence. This proves that the most important thing in our world is access to knowledge and how to use it, aka intelligence. Which means AI models are the best container for knowledge. 

The AI would tell you what you need to do first to survive. Most likely how to build a shelter with the elements you have around you. Teach you how to get fresh water. Show you which mushrooms are poisonous and which make for a tasty treat. It could entertain you with stories. Even act as a friend for companionship in a lonely place. Having a hatchet would be nice, but it's not going to help administer first aid to you when you accidentally cut yourself while chopping wood. 

Imagine trying to bring other forms of knowledge to the island. Maybe a waterproof copy of a survival manual. That would definitely help you survive the first few nights and eventually thrive on the island. But only for your most basic needs. What if you found other people on the island? Maybe a potential partner you want to settle down with and start a family? The survival book is not going to help you deliver a child. 

Instead of a survival book you could bring an entire encyclopedia. Either one of those old school physical books, or a print out of everything on Wikipedia. That could help you with a lot of things. But now your problem is knowing where to find the right knowledge to help you with new problems. Does that rash on your arm match with the description of a rare disease in the encyclopedia? Hard to say. You find another tribe on the island that speaks a different language as you and they seem pretty pissed off. Scrolling through Wikipedia for 30 minutes can't help you there. So it's not enough to have the knowledge itself at hand, but easy ways to access exactly what you need, when you need it. 

Easy access to knowledge used to be driven by search engines like Google and Bing. They could search through various information for you automatically. In a sense they condensed the entire internet into a text box to ask questions. But what came out on the other side are things that might be able to help, but not the exact knowledge you might need immediately or how to apply it to solve your problem. New AI services like ChatGPT can do just that. It knows most of what a search engine might know, but it can find the right answer immediately. It's also able to create new information never thought possible, because it wasn't in the original training data. Google may not know what to do when a completely new event like a meteorite hits your island. But ChatGPT can reason and give you the knowledge and implementation to deal with the incident. It not only knows what, it also knows how. Knowledge is power. But being able to apply knowledge correctly, aka intelligence, is even more powerful. 

What's the biggest difference between our world today in 2025 and the world in 1825? Our knowledge of things have increased, so has our intelligence. You could call this technology. But at its core it's knowing how to do something. Michael Faraday invented the theory of electromagnetism.


The crazy part of these new AI models is that knowledge is the cost of intelligence is going close to zero. Meaning it will be free and accessible to everyone. What happens when billions of people get the same level of access to knowledge and intelligence.
