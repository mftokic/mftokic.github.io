One of my siblings recently got married and had a baby. We were very happy for them to start their new life. As they were living this new life, myself and other family members realized something. They now had less time for us. Instead of coming around to the standard family events like they used to, they now had to "squeeze us in" between other things going on with their life. This become the most apparent around Christmastime. My sibling and their family now only stopped by for a few hours around the Christmas holiday, and on Christmas day this meant only seeing them for 2-3 hours. In previous years we would have been together nonstop. This broke my mom's heart. She could no longer be with all of her kids 24/7 during holidays and major events. 

It was during this Christmas that I realized something. My sibling had to deprioritize us for their spouse and eventually their new child. And that's perfectly ok. They now had a new top priority in life, and myself and other family and friends are now lower down on the list. We had to make due with this new reality and understand it could get worse in the future. I think this is why friends lose touch over the years and even best friends drift apart. It just gets hard to prioritize people in your life as new people come into it. 

The list of life priorities is something I like the call the "inner circles of life". Sounds fancy but it's just a list of what you truly prioritize and make time for in life. Let's see how that changes as we get older. 

### Age 0-1

1. Mom

When you're born, the only person that exists in your mother. Dad, who's Dad? What's a Dad? You have no idea. The only person you recognize and bond with is your Mom. No one else comes close. 

### Age 1-6 

1. Mom
2. **Dad**
3. **Grandparents, Aunt/Uncle**

Ok, now Dad comes into the picture as the second circle of your life, but Mom still holds the inner most circle. You also now get to know there are other people who love you unconditionally. These people are called Grandparents and their awesome. All they do is give you hugs and tasty food, life is awesome when they are here. Aunts and Uncles come into the picture to. They kind of look like Mom and Dad but smell different and always seem to get out of having to wipe your butt. Lucky them. 

### Age 7-12

1. Parents
2. **Friends**
3. **Siblings**
4. Relatives

Your parents still keep the top spot, but now they are more like a combined unit. Not just separate people but a singular force. Now they are telling you to do chores and keep an eye on your brothers and sisters. Who the heck are they? These people look like me but have different interests and personalities. And hey, they are mean! We don't get along that well. We always fight. So they are definitely farther down on the list. Same goes with Grandparents and other relatives. We still enjoy seeing them, but we'd rather hang out more with these people who go to school with you. People your own age who have the same interests as you. Who you see every day at school. People who give you their pudding cup just because you looked hungry. These people are your friends, and they are the best. They now take a higher spot on the list. Life starts to revolve more around your friends and less around your other family members. 

### Age 13-25

1. Friends
2. **Romantic Partners**
3. Siblings
4. Parents
5. Relatives

This is what I have come to call the "dark decade". A time where you kinda suck as a person. You might hate your parents. You might hate school. You might just hate the world. Don't worry that's just your emo phase. Friends become your top priority in life. School might be on that list too but it most likely won't come until your college years, so I've left it off the list for now. There are now others. Who might have initially looked like friends. But who you now see in a different light. They smell nice. They have shiny hair. They seem cool. You'd like to get to know them more. Maybe even kiss them right on the mouth. Yes, these are people I call romantic partners. Hopefully they do not occupy the top spot on the list. You know the saying, bros before hoes right? Wrong. At times a girlfriend, boyfriend, or someone you admire who might not know you even exist could take the top spot. You might go to a specific college on the other side of the country for them. This dark decade is where mistakes happen. Where you fail a lot. Do dumb things. Thankfully all of this dumb stuff happens when you're at a school of some sort, so the mistakes are temporary. Things you learn from and grow.  

### Age 22-26

1. **Job**
2. Romantic Partners
3. Friends
4. Parents
5. Siblings
6. Relatives

Now you're in the real world. And you need money to live. Work has now become your top priority. Don't believe me? How many of your friends took jobs in different cities after college graduation? Did you break up with your romantic partner because you both were headed to different towns to start your careers? Yup, it happens. It's ok to have your job be the top priority. You need to establish yourself at this stage in life. Build a career that's going somewhere. You also might be in a serious relationship with someone who smells nice and has shiny hair. Lucky you. This person might even move in with you. You're roommate used to be your best friend. Now you've kicked them out for a different kind of best friend, one you may want to spend every day of the rest of your life with. Friends are still high up on the list, but they might live in a different city now. You take trips to visit them, but you only have so many vacation days off work to take. You also need to balance that with time to see your parents and other family members. Now you have too many life balls in the air to juggle, so some might get dropped. When was the last time you called your Grandparents? Call them now. 

### Age 25-30 

1. **Spouse**
2. Job
3. Parents
4. Siblings
5. Friends
6. Relatives

By now you might have married your roommate who smells nice. They are now the center of your world. Where you live and sometimes any new jobs you may have to find are based on this other person. They are now the center of your world. Having a job and good friends are still high up on the list, but those fall by the wayside compared to your new spouse. You are now out of the "dark decade", so naturally your parents and siblings become fun again. You genuinely enjoy hanging out with them. Miss them when their not around. Now that you're starting to see your family more, and your job responsibilities are heating up, all of a sudden you can't see your friends 3x a week. 

### Age 30-38

1. **Kids**
2. Spouse
3. Job
4. Parents
5. Siblings
6. Friends
7. Relatives

### Age 35+

1. Kids
2. Spouse
3. Parents
4. Siblings
5. Friends
6. **Job**
7. Relatives
