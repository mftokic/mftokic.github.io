Everybody has a lot to say about education in America. The ability to learn and apply knowledge, aka intelligence, is [the most important thing to develop in our lives](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-01-31-knowledge/). But schools seem to be missing the mark on this. They do some things right, but more things wrong. 

Here is a breakdown of many things schools do wrong, and a few of what they do right. 

## What's Bad About School

### Form of Governmental Control

Saying the pledge of allegiance every day. Control over what you learn.

### Schools Are Just Factories

### Early Start and End Times 

Why do adults work 9-5 but kids go to school from 7-3? 

### Summer

### School Lunches 

### No Choice of Teachers

### No Control Over Lesson Plan 

Can't learn what you're most interested in. Can't learn skills that actually give you a job. Can't learn broader life skills.

### Single Speed Learning 

Single track learning, not mastery learning. Tied to grades that move one step at a time. Skipping grades can ruin your social life. 

### Tests Are Not Real Life 

Learn for the test, not for real life. State and federal testing facilitates funding, so teachers also teach for the test. People optimize for grades. This makes the joy of learning a job, which takes away any intrinsic motivation to continue learning outside of school. 

### Too Expensive

### Often A Decade Behind Trends

Never adopt new technology in time. Anti AI today. Rows of desk facing a chalkboard doesn't make sense anymore. 

### Less Yard Time Than a Prison

The architect who designed my high school mainly designed prisons. Coincidence? 

### More Bullies Than a Prison 

### Social Media Corrupts Schools

### Peer Pressure

### No Parental Freedom

Have to build your life around the school. Restricts when you wake up, when you travel, what you want your kid to learn, what kind of job you need to pay for the school. 

### Getting Into a Good College

### Teacher Salaries

Paid nothing. Get no supplies from gov, often spending money out of their own pocket. Jump around to multiple districts to pad their pensions. Anything that has a union basically means the worker s are being taken advantaged of. 

### Good Schools Are Expensive 

Pay for the things around learning, not for the learning itself. Better facilities, better network, better families, better after school activities. 

## What's Good About School 

### Networks

### Socialization 

Girls being with boys. Being forced to ask someone to a dance. Learning how to get along. Making friends. 

### Sports

## Ways to Fix School 

### Tutors Create the Best Results

### Combine homeschool with AI
