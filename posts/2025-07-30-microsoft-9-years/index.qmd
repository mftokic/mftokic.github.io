Intro. Talk about starting work in 2015 as intern. 

### 1. People Love You, Companies Don't

When an athlete on a sports team does a good job then leaves the team, they get a statue built of them. When an employee does a good job then leaves a company, they get a firm handshake and a thank you. Maybe a cake if they're lucky. No jersey's hung up in the rafter, no statue outside of the stadium. And that's ok. 

Early in my career I thought of trying to make myself indispensable to my team. Where if I left there would be this crater sized whole left on the team that no one could fill. Basically I wanted them to miss me if I left. I've realized this is dumb. The company will not care if you leave, but people will. I've worked with a lot of great people, but once they leave it's like we have some sort of short term memory on the team. A what have you done for me lately mentality. 

### 2. Meetings Are Corporate Junk Food

I believe meetings are a form of laziness. Empty calories that add unneeded bloat to an operation. It's the easiest form of coordination, but also the least effective. People schedule them as a forcing function for others to get their work done, or as time to actually do the work itself during the meeting. This makes my skill crawl. If someone is not responding to your Teams messages or email, you might set up a meeting with them. This is not ideal. 

### 3. No One Cares How Hard You Work

### 4. Managers Are Temporary

### 5. Saying No Is A Superpower

### 6. You Can Just Do Things

### 7. Don't Work Under A Rock

### 8. The Reward For Good Work Is More Work

### 9. Nothing Is As Good Or Bad As It Seems
