### Let's Break ARIMA Down

Arima stands for auto-regressive integrated moving average. That sounds like a mouthful so we'll take it step by step on how each component works. 

- **AR (Auto-Regressive)**: The current value depends on past values of itself
- **I (Integrated)**: Difference the data to make it [stationary](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/)
- **MA (Moving Average)**: The current value depends on past prediction errors

### Auto-Regressive

An arima model will create lags of the target variable (the variable you want to forecast into the future) to help learn trends and patterns in the data.
