### What Gets Measured, Gets Managed

Our bodies are mostly a mystery to a regular person. Everyone takes vitamins, but do they actually help your body operate better? If you don't know what kind of vitamins your body needs theres a good chance supplements you take every day are actively hurting your body or are simply being pissed down the drain (literally). Unabsorbed by your body. Nobody wants to take something that is a waste of time. So how do you know what nutrients your body needs? This is where understanding methylation in your body comes in. 

### What's Methylation 

Methylation is the process of converting nutrients you eat into things your body can actually use. We eat crude oil in the form of food, and our body processes it into gasoline in the form of nutrients to use for various processes that help us thrive. The issue is that our body rarely does this all perfectly. Many of us have gene mutations that inhibit this kind of conversation process. Let's walk through some of the most common gene mutations around methylation and see how we can make sure our bodies are operating at their maximal potential. 

### MTHFR

Commonly known as the "mother fucker" gene, this one can be a real mother fucker. Up to 44% of people in the world carry this gene mutation. MTHFR deals with how our body handles the nutrient called folate. It translates the folate we get from our food into a form our bodies can use called methylfolate or 5-MTHF, which is the methylated version of folate. 

5-MTHF helps break down a compound in our body called homocysteine. some have called it the most inflamatory compound in the human body. Inflammation is very bad for our body folks. When this compound is high all crazy types of things happen. Here are just a couple of things that are impacted. 

- Creating neurotransmitters 
- DNA repair
- Detoxing
- Regulating blood pressure
- Miscarriages during pregnancy
- Anxiety

Folate can be found in leafy greens and legumes. But the most common way we consume folate is through a compound called folic acid. Folic acid is the most common additive to our food. It's literally everywhere. White rice and can flour contain folic acid. When ingredients say "fortified" or "enriched", that means folic acid was added. This is bad news for people with the MTHFR mutation because they cannot process folic acid into the form our body needs. I will repeat, folic acid is the most common additive in food but cannot be properly processed by almost half of the worlds population. It's even found in some prenatal vitamins, which has been linked to miscarriages and postpartum depression. Not good! 

I know this is kind of scary to read, but thankfully there is some good news. There are easy ways to work around this gene mutation and ensure you are thriving in life. Here's what to do. 

- Avoid all forms of folic acid, which limits your processed food intake, which is a major health win overall
- Take the methylated version of folate, [called 5-MTHF](https://a.co/d/4TwoR4o), at night before going to bed

### MTR 

Similar to MTHFR, the MTR gene also plays in a role in regulating homocysteine by converting it into another compound called methionine. For this reaction to work, your body needs vitamin B12, specifically the methylated versions of B12 like methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin. 

If you have this gene mutation, you may experience certain gut issues. 

- Gas
- Bloating 
- Diarrhea
- Constipation 
- Cramping 

Supplementing with B12 is crucial for this gene mutation, but similar to MTHFR not all supplements are created equal. Stay away from a form of B12 called Cyanocobalamin. This form contains hydrogen cyanide, which is a known neurotoxin. It's also added into cheap energy drinks and even milk! Companies do this because it's cheap and they don't care, so care for yourself and avoid it at all costs.  

Here's what to do if you have this gene mutation.

- Limit alcohol, which depletes methyl donors and can interfere with B12 absorption
- Avoid heavy metals (like mercury and lead) that bind to B12, making it unavailable for MTR to use
- Take the methylated version of B12, either methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin found in [methylated multivitamins](https://a.co/d/fHQiO9z)
    - FYI not everyone can process methylcobalamin, but 100% of humans can process hydroxocobalamin in their body
    - If you also have the COMT gene mutation, you absolutely should be taking hydroxocobalamin since your body can process that better than other forms like methylcobalamin

### MTRR 

This gene works closely with the MTR gene, hence similar names. It helps reactivate B12 that was used by the MTR gene when converting homocysteine into methionine. Over time B12 can become oxidized when used by the MTR gene, so MTRR comes in to convert it back into its methylated form so it can be properly used again. MTRR is also important in the thyroid, helping convert one important thyroid hormone T4 into T3, which happens in your gut. 

If you have this gene mutation, you might suffer from the following. 

- Heart burn
- Acid reflux
- Thyroid issues
- Short temper 
- High blood pressure
- Exacerbations of ADD, ADHD, OCD

Follow the same guidelines as described in the MTR section above. Avoid the wrong types of B12 and make sure to take versions that your body can actually use. 

### AHCY 

This gene helps break down S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) into homocysteine and adenosine. This process is critical because SAH is a strong inhibitor of methylation enzymes. If it builds up, it slows down methylation reactions throughout the body. SAH is one of the most inflammatory compounds in your body, even worse than homocysteine. 

This is a rare gene mutation to have, but people with it can have addictive tendencies. For example, addiction to video games as kids, then phones as teenagers, then drugs, alcohol, sugar, working out, eating, sex, shopping, working. This is caused by wide ranges in dopamine in the body, which is tied to our behaviors. So people with this mutation tend to seek out dopamine rewarding behavior. 

Here's what to do if you have this gene mutation.

- Consume collagen to ensure your ingesting enough glycine to help your body balance methionine. If AHCY isnâ€™t efficiently breaking down SAH, excess methionine intake might lead to toxic byproducts instead of proper methylation.

### COMT 

This gene breaks down major neurotransmitters in the body. Things like dopamine and adrenaline. It's also responsible for metabolizing estrogens, and having too much of this hormone for both men and women can be bad. When your body can't break these these things, all sorts of things get out of whack. 

If you have this gene mutation, you might suffer from the following. 

- Stress and anxiety 
- Trouble winding down and sleeping
- Quick to anger, slow to calm down
- Higher estrogen levels, which can lead to water retention under the belly button and around the waist
- Pain sensitivity 
- ADD or ADHD

Thankfully it's not all bad with this gene mutation. Because things like dopamine stay around longer in your brain, it can lead to higher creativity and deep thinking. But this comes at a cost of overanalyzing and worrying. 

Here's what to do if you have this gene mutation.
