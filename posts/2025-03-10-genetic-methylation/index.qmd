### What Gets Measured, Gets Managed

Our bodies are mostly a mystery to a regular person. Everyone takes vitamins, but do they actually help your body operate better? If you don't know what kind of vitamins your body needs theres a good chance supplements you take every day are actively hurting your body or are simply being pissed down the drain (literally) unabsorbed by your body. Nobody wants to take something that is a waste of time or worse. So how do you know what nutrients your body needs? This is where understanding methylation in your body comes in. 

### What's Methylation 

Methylation is the process of converting nutrients you eat into things your body can actually use. We eat crude oil, and our body processes it into gasoline to use for various processes that help us thrive. The issue is that our body rarely does this all perfectly. Many of us have gene mutations that inhibit this kind of conversation process.
