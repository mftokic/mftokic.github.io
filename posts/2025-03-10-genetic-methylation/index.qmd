### What Gets Measured, Gets Managed

Our bodies are mostly a mystery to a regular person. Everyone takes vitamins, but do they actually help your body operate better? If you don't know what kind of vitamins your body needs theres a good chance supplements you take every day are actively hurting your body or are simply being pissed down the drain (literally). Unabsorbed by your body. Nobody wants to take something that is a waste of time. So how do you know what nutrients your body needs? This is where understanding methylation in your body comes in. 

### What's Methylation 

Methylation is the process of converting nutrients you eat into things your body can actually use. We eat crude oil in the form of food, and our body processes it into gasoline in the form of nutrients to use for various processes that help us thrive. The issue is that our body rarely does this all perfectly. Many of us have gene mutations that inhibit this kind of conversation process. Let's walk through some of the most common gene mutations around methylation and see how we can make sure our bodies are operating at their maximal potential. 

### MTHFR

Commonly known as the "mother fucker" gene, this one can be a real mother fucker. Up to 46% of people in the world carry this gene mutation. MTHFR deals with how our body handles the nutrient called folate. It translates the folate we get from our food into a form our bodies can use called 5-MTHF, which is the methylated version of folate. 

Folate helps break down a compound in our body called homocysteine. When this compound is high all crazy types of things happen. Here are just a couple of things that are impacted. 

- Creating neurotransmitters 
- DNA repair
- Detoxing
- Regulating blood pressure
- Miscarriages during pregnancy

Folate can be found in leafy greens and legumes. But the most common way we consume folate is through a compound called folic acid. Folic acid is the most common additive to our food. It's literally everywhere. White rice and can flour contain folic acid. When ingredients say "fortified" or "enriched", that means folic acid was added. This is bad news for people with the MTHFR mutation because they cannot process folic acid into the form our body needs. I will repeat, folic acid is the most common additive in food but cannot be properly processed by almost half of the worlds population. It's even found in some prenatal vitamins, which has been linked to miscarriages and postpartum depression. Not good! 

I know this is kind of scary to read, but thankfully there is some good news. There are easy ways to work around this gene mutation and ensure you are thriving in life. Here's what to do. 

- Avoid all forms of folic acid, which limits your processed food intake, which is a major health win overall
