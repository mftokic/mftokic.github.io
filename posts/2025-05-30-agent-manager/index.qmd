### AI Layoffs Have Started

Would you rather have your company spend 10x less or achieve 10x more? These are the two ends of the AI productivity spectrum. Right now senior leaders seem to be on the "spend 10x less" side, which is a bummer. The fastest way to grow earnings it seems is by cutting costs. They want to use AI tools that allow them to get the job done with less resources. This might make sense in a cash cow business with few competitors, but that's rare and puts your business at risk of AI powered disruption. As Jeff Bezos used to say, "your margin is my opportunity".  

Spending 10x less is a known quantity, CFO's can show how this impacts the bottom line and rewards shareholders. So of the two choices it's the lower hanging fruit. Choosing to be 10x more productive with the same resources you have available is less certain. Will it lead to 10x sales? Maybe, but maybe not. This combined with economic uncertainty makes the choice easy for the CEO. They think they can make cuts AND achieve more, all powered by AI. Can you have your cake and eat it too? No one knows just yet. 

We are starting to see less hiring in the tech space, even layoffs. When people leave teams, no one hires their back fill. That was the first wave of "silent layoffs", now there are "loud layoffs" with thousands getting let go at major companies. This could be the start of a bigger trend. The classic tech era depictions on the HBO show "Silicon Valley" are now probably dead. The golden age of being a software developer are done. For decades, life was good if you had a rare set of skills that the world had an undying need for (writing code), but now AI can write the code. So the prickly coder who is a pain to work with but kept your companies core systems running is going from a necessary pain to one that can be fixed easily with AI powered tools. Specifically agentic AI systems that can do work on their own much like a person. 

They say 2025 is the year of the AI agents, which you can also rephrase as the year of "non-human labor". That is both terrifying and exciting. It's only terrifying if you don't change anything about your life, and very exciting if you know how to ride the wave. Let's dig in. 

### Forms of Leverage

Naval Ravikant states there are three types of leverage. 

1. **Labor**: people working for you
2. **Capital**: using money to build things
3. **Permissionless**: code and media that works while you sleep

Labor is the oldest form of leverage with the greatest prestige, capital has been the most popular in recent decades, but permissionless leverage is the hot new thing that is getting turbocharged by AI. 

Think about how companies got off in the ground in the last decade. It was common to go raise a bunch of money around an idea, then hire a bunch of people to go build the idea, then use what you built (often through code) to make a profit. That's how the companies got the most amount of leverage in the least amount of time. Just like Tony Montana: first you get the money, then you get the labor, then you get the profit. It's a model that works, but one that requires permission. People have to agree to give you money, or agree to work with you. 

In recent years this model was disrupted partly by people who are experts at either code or media. Joe Rogan makes tens of millions every year through his podcast, which at most is probably operated by 3-5 people. Instagram sold to Facebook for one billion with only a dozen employees. These people did not need permission to start a podcast or go build a viral app. They were using forms of permissionless leverage. 

Permissionless leverage is now becoming orders of magnitude more important with the power of AI. AI is removing the need for the first two forms of leverage, labor and capital. Before you needed money to hire a team, but now AI is your team in the form of agents. 

### AI Agent = Agency

When AI agents can start doing tasks similar to a human, what's left for humans to do? 

The most important skill to have in this new AI future is proactively taking action, also known as having a high degree of agency. Being a high agency person means you get shit done. No one has to tell you what to do. You are proactively doing things. 

Having access to AI agents that can do human work for a few bucks now allows you to do anything you want. The only problem now is taking the agency to go out and do it. Have an idea for a company? Now you can deploy agents to get it off the ground. 

- Build the product (app or service)
- Track down potential customers to purchase the product, even sell to them 
- Answer support related questions from customers 
- Analyze the finances and recommend what market to expand into next
- Create marketing content to attract more customers

People used to do these jobs, now agents are coming to do them. They will be used by people who have high agency, folks who go out and make a dent in the world instead of being told what to do. 

### Future Career Paths

Career paths in a post AI agent world will never be the same again. Historically an ambitious career path might have looked like this. 

1. **Intern**: You don't know anything, but are there to learn and try not to slow the team down too much. 
2. **Junior Employee**: You are fresh out of school and ready to kick ass. You get the lowest level work that needs to get done, but doing it well grows your reputation for doing good work. 
3. **Senior Employee**: You have gotten so good at your job that now your boss wants you coming up with fresh ideas and running new initiatives. You now have more freedom to choose what you work on and how you get it done because you've proven to be reliable. 
4. **People Manager**: Congrats, you've kicked so much butt at the senior level that you are now in charge of your own team. Now you are really calling the shots and providing the direction for your employees to run to. The individual contributor work you did is now out the window. People rely on you to make decisions, not to output work items. 
5. **Senior Management**: You've proved that you can run successful teams, and the top dogs think you have real potential so they move you up to the big leagues. Now you are looking over teams of teams, which is a whole other level of decision making and judgement. Now you are in charge of the strategic vision of the organization, and 3-5 year roadmaps. Everything is long term and at a 30,000 ft view. The days of tiny details are over for you, you simply don't have the time for it. 
6. **C-Suite**: The final stop on a lifelong career, the mountain top. The highest summit for which to have impact. Single decisions made by you now impact thousands of employees and even shape financial markets. Shareholders are relying on you to make the right choices. 

If you were good at your job and had leadership potential, the next logical step was to rise to the next level. The act of progress leads to happiness, so making progress on this career ladder has the potential to make you happy. Do you see how each new level of the ladder gives you more access to labor and capital leverage? 

What happens when AI agents come into the picture. How does this career ladder change? An army of labor is now accessible starting at the intern level, with the same level of access as the C-Suite. These agents don't take breaks or cost tens of thousands. They start off at a few bucks a month and scaling them might cost thousands, not tens of thousands like a human. I think corporate careers will start to turn into the career paths of musicians and athletes. 

Let's take Taylor Swift as an example. Taylor Swift came onto the scene over 15 years ago back when I was in high school. Since then what she does has not changed much. She still writes songs, she still performs in from of fans. What has changed is the level at which she does it. Her most recent tour, the Eras Tour, made over a billion dollars. That's insane. At no point in her career did a music exec say "you're so good at your job, we're going to promote you to running the record label". Instead she was given every resource imaginable to do what she does best at the next highest level. Over the past 15 years she has continued to level up. Doing bigger and better shows until now becoming the biggest artist in the world. 

I believe people in the corporate world will do something similar. The best person at the world at something will now do it for everyone in the world. Not just for one company. 

One person brand.
