### Personalized Medicine & Preventive Health

#### Genomics-Driven Supplement “Playbook”
- Kevin sequenced his **entire genome** for ≈ $700 (full‐genome, not 23-and-Me).  
- AI + VCF file located an *MTHFR* mutation ➜ explains chronically high **homocysteine** (CVD risk marker).  
- Iterative stack (added one lever at a time):
  - Methyl-B vitamins (methyl-folate, methyl-B12).  
  - **N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC)** as extra methyl donor → finally dropped homocysteine to *normal range* after “years of failure.”  
- Take-away → expect LLM-driven “omic” protocols that surface *root-cause* bottlenecks, not just blanket supplement lists.

#### Annual Check-ups & Early Detection
- Colonoscopy schedule: Tim keeps rigid 5-year cadence after friend’s fatal metastatic colon cancer.  
  - Pro-tip: ask anesthesiologist for a **“slow ramp”** propofol drip (60 s mild euphoria before lights-out).  
- Full-body MRI: caught a stable micro-aneurysm in Kevin’s brain; now scanned yearly.  
  - Downside = “incidentalomas” (false positives you must learn to ignore).  
- **GRAIL blood test** as needle-only multi-cancer screen for claustrophobic patients.  
- Baseline literacy books ­→ *Bad Science* (Ben Goldacre) for media-hype triage.

### Everyday Bio-Optimization Toolkit

| Tool / Habit | Key Details | Practical Tip |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **WHOOP “MG”** | 12 % smaller; cuff-calibrated BP, ECG spot check, VO₂ max, “Whoop Age” composite. | Set custom HR zones or import lab VO₂ max to refine Zone-2 training. |
| **Zone 2 cardio** | “Talk test” ≈ can speak full sentences, wouldn’t choose to. | Aim 30–60 min daily; compare wearables with *Quantified Scientist* benchmarks. |
| **Profi nasal hydro-gel** | Stanford tech; traps viruses/bacteria in mucosal matrix. | 1 spray/nostril pre-flight or large indoor events. |
| **Dashi tea-bags** | Okui 1871 packs bonito + anchovy + kelp as single-serve sachets. | Use like morning tea/coffee; mineral-rich umami without caffeine. |
| **Peloton seat caution** | Narrow saddle → perineal compression → numbness, fertility risk. | Swap seat or move to air-rower/Assault-bike with adjustable saddle. |

### Sobriety Journey & Liver Reset

- Kevin: **26+ dry days** (goal ≥ 90).
  - Liver enzymes AST/ALT fell **150 → low-30s**.  
  - Mood “+10 % baseline” and reduced sensitivity to criticism.  
- Tools & mindsets  
  - 24-hour pledge: “Not today—tomorrow is undecided.”  
  - Phone-a-friend contact sheet; weekly men-only Zoom for accountability.  
  - Substitute hobbies: adult **LEGO art** (*Great Wave* 1 k pcs), Nanoblocks cherry-blossom, golf w/ spouse.  
- Aphorisms  
  - “Drinking is **borrowing happiness from tomorrow**.”  
  - “Discipline is the strongest form of self-love.”

### Neuro-Tech & Mental-Health Experiments

#### Accelerated TMS (SAINT protocol)
| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Course** | 50 sessions × 9 min over 5 days (10 hrs total). |
| **Target** | Anxiometic coil placement for OCD/rumination. |
| **Outcome #1** | 2-week latency → 3–4 months full-symptom remission. |
| **Outcome #2** | 1-day & 3-day boosters = no effect. |
| **Hypothesis** | Remission amplified by **psychedelic priming** ➜ heightened neuroplasticity. |
| **Side-effect** | Transient *delayed ejaculation* (likely trazodone, not TMS). |

> **Insurance** covers conventional TMS for TR-depression; accelerated protocols may follow once cost-benefit data mature.

### AI, Privacy & the “Trust Layer”

- Deep-fake Tim Ferriss ads (stock-tips) → 90 % realistic; glitchy head-tilts only giveaway.  
- LLMs fabricate persuasive product copy (*$6 headphones > $500 model* test).  
- **World ID** iris scan stores zero-knowledge proof on device → reusable “proof of personhood.”  
- Digg 2.0 (Kevin + Alexis Ohanian) exploring **ZK-proof badges** (e.g., “verified 5-yr Oura user”) to filter bot content.  
- Tim deleted 23-and-Me data post-acquisition: genome anonymity is illusion; custom bio-agents feasible once LLMs pair with wet-labs.

### Travel, Culture & Experiential Picks

#### Taiwan (visit *before* PRC re-absorption?)
- Locals oddly placid about geopolitics.  
- Highlights:  
  - **“Really Good Seafood”** (bronze sculptures inside).  
  - Oriental Beauty Oolong & rainforest hikes < 60 min from Taipei.  

#### Japan Coffee Circuit
1. **Glitch** (Ginza) – latte w/ Hokkaido milk “witchcraft.”  
2. **Bear Pond** – “Angel-stain” viscous espresso.  
3. **Send Gold** – Colombian wine-yeast peach-honey beans.  
4. **Café Mameya** – reservation-only; serves aged geishas in wine snifters.

*Tip:* Yen weakness → tourist surge; book Studio-Ghibli tickets months ahead.

#### Indie/Low-Stim Entertainment
- *32 Sounds* (headphones a must) – immersive docu-meditation on sound.  
- *Flow* – Latvian low-poly, wordless post-apocalyptic cat saga; visual acclimation ≈ 5 min.  
- Adult LEGO “art series,” Nanoblocks cherry-blossom, POJ Studio for Japanese home goods.

### Meditation & Inner Work

| Retreat Style | Classic Sesshin | Hybrid “Warm-Bath” (NM mini-retreat) |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Wake-up       | 4–5 a.m.        | 9 a.m.                               |
| Silence       | 100 %           | Mixed: silent sits + dialog breaks   |
| Food          | Oryoki mush     | Café lunches + group dinner          |
| Tim’s Outcome | Nervous-system crash (prior Vipassana) | Safe re-entry; regained momentum; now daily *Way* sessions |

*Way* app ⇒ 30 free sits → <https://thewayapp.com/tim>

**Books for practice**  
- Anthony de Mello *Awareness* – lecture transcripts, dense insights.  
- Paul Madonna *Everything Is Its Own Reward* – illustrated urban essays; makes ordinary magic visible.

### Entrepreneurship & Play

- **Coyote** (Ferriss × Exploding Kittens)  
  - Social bluff party game; Walmart exclusive → top seller; gameplay videos = most-watched in EK history.

- **True Ventures** invests \$15 M in UCSF protein tackling Alzheimer’s/dementia; Kevin joins board.
