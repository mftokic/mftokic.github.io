### Personalized Medicine & Preventive Health

#### Genomics-Driven Playbooks
- **Whole-genome sequencing now <$1 k**; actionable variants like *MTHFR* surfaced fast.  
- Kevin fed genome data to an LLM ➜ designed methyl-donor stack (methyl-B vitamins + NAC) that normalized chronic homocysteine in 8 weeks.  
- Expect AI-omics pipelines to accelerate bespoke supplement/drug combos and UCSF-style novel proteins for dementia.

#### Regular Screening Saves Lives
- Colonoscopy (propofol “slow ramp”) + annual full-body MRI caught early issues in friends.  
- **GRAIL blood test** offers multi-cancer screen for MRI-averse patients.  
- Baseline science literacy (*Bad Science*) curbs scan anxiety and media hype.

#### Everyday Bio-Optimizations
- **WHOOP MG** band: smaller; cuff-calibrated BP, VO₂ max, “Whoop Age,” ECG spot-checks, AI coach.  
- **Zone 2 cardio** (talk-test or custom HR zones) for mitochondrial fitness; Quantified Scientist benchmarks wearables.

### Sobriety & Mental Health

#### 90-Day Alcohol Reset
- Kevin’s ALT/AST 150 → low-30s and mood up after 26 dry days, aided by:  
  - 24-hour “Not today” mindset from 12-step culture.  
  - Phone-a-friend list & weekly men’s Zoom.  
  - Replacement hobbies (adult Lego, bonsai Nanoblocks, golf).  
- **Quotes**  
  - “Drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.”  
  - “I had my first drink—and my last—to feel like a grown-up.”  
  - “Discipline is the strongest form of self-love.”

#### Tech-Assisted Therapy
- **Accelerated TMS** (50 × 9-min sessions/5 days) gave Tim 3–4 months of OCD remission; psychedelic priming may boost neuroplasticity.  
- Trazodone caused delayed ejaculation; consumer brain-zappers mostly ineffective or risky.  
- Insurers may soon cover accelerated protocols; combine with metabolic psychiatry (keto, exogenous ketones) for durable gains.

### AI, Data Privacy & the Trust Crisis

#### Exploding Possibilities
- AI + AlphaFold compress decades of protein discovery; UAE wiring government & genomics at national scale.  
- LLMs craft deep-fake gurus & fake reviews (e.g., $6 headphones “beating” $500 sets).

#### Proving You’re Human
- **World ID** iris scans yield private on-device proofs.  
- Digg 2.0 exploring ZK-proof badges (e.g., verified 5-year Oura subscriber).  
- Genome data is never truly anonymous; Tim deleted 23-and-Me data post-acquisition scare.

### Travel, Culture & Lifestyle

#### Taiwan Highlights
- Go soon—cultural shift feels inevitable; locals oddly calm.  
- Must-tries: “Really Good Seafood,” Oriental Beauty Oolong, rainforest hikes <1 hr from Taipei.

#### Japan Coffee Circuit
- Glitch (Ginza), Bear Pond, Send Gold, Café Mameya (aged brews).  
- Souvenirs: POJ Studio for artisan imports, Nijya markets for affordable teas/dashi.

#### Low-Stimulation Entertainment
- *32 Sounds* documentary (headphones!).  
- *Flow* (wordless low-poly Latvian animation) rewards 5 min acclimation.

### Meditation, Awareness & Inner Work

#### Hybrid Zen Retreat
- Small-group (8 ppl) talk-enabled format with Henry Shukman + Valerie = “warm-bath” re-entry vs. monastic sesshin.  
- Multiple daily sits build momentum; even Tim (post-Vipassana crash) found it healing.  
- *Way* app — 30 free sessions → <https://thewayapp.com/tim>

#### Mindfulness Aids
- **Books**  
  - Anthony De Mello *Awareness* (insight-dense).  
  - Paul Madonna *Everything Is Its Own Reward* (illustrated essays on noticing the everyday miracle).  
- Tea-time dashi, Lego art, Japanese incense double as sober anchors.

### Play & Entrepreneurship

#### Coyote Card Game
- Tim × Exploding Kittens collab; top-seller at Walmart, viral gameplay videos (tens of millions).  
- Mechanics: bluff / probability twist on rock-paper-scissors.

#### Digg 2.0
- Kevin + Alexis Ohanian reviving Digg as human-verified discussion hub to counter AI spam.

### Key Meta-Themes
1. **Proactive Health > Reactive Care** — genome-to-wearable stack.  
2. **Tech as Amplifier** — same AI enables healing *and* harm; verification layer crucial.  
3. **Meaningful Constraints** — sobriety, meditation, screening schedules create freedom.  
4. **Rediscover Ordinary Wonder** — soundscapes, tea rituals, Lego builds turn mundane moments magical.
