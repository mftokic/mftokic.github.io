    "title": "Time Series First Principles: The Future Is Similar To The Past",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Time Series First Principles Series\nThis post dives into the third principle of a good time series forecast, the future is similar to the past. Check out the initial post in this series to get a high level view of each principle.\n\nDomain Expertise\nGarbage In Garbage Out\nThe Future Is Similar To The Past\nHigher Grain Higher Accuracy\nOrder Is Important\nThe Magic Is In The Feature Engineering\nSimple Models Are Better Models\nCapture Uncertainty\nModel Averages Are King\nDeep Learning Last\n\n\n\nHere Comes The Sun\nFor whatever you’re trying to forecast, it will be a lot easier to do with with machine learning (ML) if the future is similar to the past. It’s as simple as that.\nWhen you open the weather app on your phone, have you ever looked at when the sun is expected to rise and set? If you’re on the new human optimization craze about getting morning sunlight, you most likely have. That forecast is down to the minute, most likely even second, and has a high degree of accuracy. Is the forecast accurate because of expert human judgement, or the type of weather related features fed into a ML model? Nope. It’s accurate because the sun has risen and set at relatively the same time, based on time of year, for millions of years. We don’t expect future sun rises and sun sets to change that much going forward, that’s why your weather app gives you an exact time for the sun rise but gives you only a percent probability of rain. Even then, that chance of rain may not even be accurate. It’s almost a joke now how many times in Seattle I’ve seen a dry forecast only to step out of my house and have it immediately start raining. At least I know the exact minute when the sun will set that day.\n\n\nHandling A Changing Future\nYour business is most likely not like the sun. It’s constantly changing, reacting to market forces and industry competitors. The best way to teach a model about your expectations of the future is to give it data about the past and future.\nLet’s use an example of a monthly revenue forecast for a product. If you only use historical sales data to forecast the product, then you are making the assumption that the future of the product will be almost identical to the past, especially the most recent past. For some established products in mature industries this could be totally fine, but often this is not the case.\nOne thing to try is adding features that can explain how outside forces impact the product. For example, how much money consumers have to spend might greatly impact who buys your product. So using an economic feature like consumer sentiment can help a model adjust it’s predictions based on changes in consumer spending habits.\nWe can add features into our data in two ways. The first is to just give historical values of that feature. This will force us to only use historical lags of the feature when training a ML model, since we don’t know what the future value of that feature will be. We can take that original feature and create new features (this is called feature engineering). Ones that are a 3 month lag, 6 month lag, or 12 month lag of the original data. Often macro data like consumer sentiment can be a lagging indicator. Meaning their impact is delayed and takes a while to flow through the economy. Changes in consumer sentiment from 6 months ago can actually have a strong correlation with how customers purchase our product today.\nA second way is to use both historical values and future values. We could use a future forecast of consumer sentiment in our model, in addition to using the historical data. That way a model can learn from any lagged relationships as well as understand how changes in consumer sentiment impact our product in real time. These future values can either come from an expert forecast (like from famous economists) or created by your own ML solution.\n\n\nThe Future Must Always Learn From The Past\nYou might have a ton of ideas for new kinds of future information your can encode as features to train a model. In order to use this data we need to make sure there are historical examples for a model to learn from. The upcoming 2024 presidential election in the US could have a large impact on your business, which will impact your future forecast for the rest of 2024. We know exactly when the election is going to happen, so it’s easy to give that information into a ML model to learn from.\nThe catch is we need to make sure that we show examples from the past to allow the model to learn how previous elections impact our business and how the model should handle similar events in the future. If we only have product sales data from the last three years, then we cannot feed it future election data because we don’t have the data from the 2020 or 2016 US presidential elections.\nIf we know something is going to happen in the future, but we can’t quantify it with historical data for a model, then we need to go old school. Instead we need to use our domain expertise about the business to take the ML output, without knowledge of the future event, and make a manual adjustment to the forecast based on the expected impact of the future. For the election example, maybe your product sales will grow as we get closer to the election, so if you don’t have enough historical data for a model to learn about the election’s impact you can make a manual adjustment to the ML forecast based on your assumption about the election’s impact.\nThis kind of hybrid approach, ML first with a light human touch second, can create a powerful combination. A ML model can do 80-90% of the initial work and a human can make the final manual adjustments based on their domain expertise. This allows a human to add more insight into a forecast that is not easily quantifiable for a ML model to learn from.\n\n\nNew Time Series\nA new product at your company might be exciting, but is harder to forecast accurately with ML models. The lack of historical data will make it hard for any new ML model to learn from. Initial trends and seasonality may not always carry into the future. For example there might be a big spike in initial sales around release but then taper off over time. The new product may not even be on sale yet, so you are now tasked with forecasting something with zero historical data.\nIf the time series in question has some historical data, ideally more than one year of historical observations, a good way to deal with it is to train a ML model with the new time series alongside similar existing products with a lot of historical data. This is sometimes called a “global model”, where a model learns from multiple time series instead of one. Training on one specific time series is sometimes called a “local model”. Training a global model allows the ML model to learn general trends and seasonality patters across similar time series and apply it to the newer time series. This can work well if the other time series are similar to one another.\nIf the product you want to forecast has no historical data, then you are in a tough boat. Traditional time series methods cannot help you, since they all rely on quality historical data. What you can do is take a more traditional machine learning regression approach. This involves taking all historical products that have launched over time and training a model to understand the initial demand of a new product and how it either grows or shrinks over time. For example with iPhone sales, you can train a model on the initial sales of each iPhone model from V1 to V14, then use that model to predict the kind of demand the latest V15 iPhone might have. This type of approach would need a more detailed post to explain fully, but hopefully you get the broader picture.\nTo learn more about forecasting new time series, check out the forecasting bible written by our forecasting godfather Rob Hyndman. The chapter on judgemental forecasts goes deep into forecasting new products and discusses other approaches you can take.\n\n\nReversal\nWhen using future values of a feature, there is a risk of compounding errors. Let’s go back to the consumer sentiment example. If you create your own expectation of future consumer sentiment, or use an economist’s prediction, there is a good chance the forecast will be wrong. If the forecast about consumer sentiment is wrong, and that forecast is fed into a model to predict your product’s sales, then your sales forecast will be even more wrong. The errors compound. Add in other features and you can see how the house of cards can tumble pretty fast. Always be weary about using future values of features where you don’t have 100% confidence in their future value. For example using future holiday features are great because they will always happen on a specific day with 100% certainty, but trying to tell a model where inflation is headed in the future can get you in trouble.\nHaving a human make manual adjustments after the initial ML forecast can add unneeded human bias to the final forecast. This bias can sometimes be wrong and hurt the accuracy of the forecast. It’s good practice to capture these adjustments and always report on the forecast accuracy of the pure ML model and the accuracy for the model + human adjustments. That way you can track how helpful the manual adjustments are, and remember why they were made in the first place.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen embarking on the journey of time series forecasting, remember it’s more art than exact science—akin to predicting rain in Seattle. The key takeaway? Use the past as a guide but sprinkle in educated guesses about the future with caution. Whether you’re launching new products or navigating established markets, blending machine learning with a dash of human intuition can create robust forecasts. May your forecasts be as reliable as the sunrise, with just enough flexibility to handle an unexpected downpour."

    "title": "Thoughts on First Principles in Time Series Forecasting",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been doing time series forecasting with machine learning (ML) most of my career. I believe it’s still the best AI opportunity in corporate finance, even with all of the latest Generative AI developments in recent years. If you work for the CFO, chances are you often create predictions about the future. Those predictions take time and can always be more accurate. Machine learning can help in both areas. Before you build machine learning solutions in your finance org, it’s important to understand the true building blocks of making good forecasts.\nIn this post I will overview each first principle, and have follow-up posts digging deeper into each one. Let’s dive in.\n\nDomain Expertise: Knowing what factors actually influence what you are trying to forecast is more important than which ML model to train.\nGarbage In Garbage Out: Training a model on bad data leads to bad forecasts.\nThe Future Is Similar To The Past: If you expect the future to be drastically different than past data, you will have a hard time training accurate models.\n\nHigher Grain Higher Accuracy: Forecasting by country is often more accurate than forecasting by city. Forecasting by month is often more accurate than forecasting by day.\nOrder Is Important: When time is involved, how your data is ordered makes all the difference.\nThe Magic Is In The Feature Engineering: How you transform your data before model training can transform a mediocre forecast into a world class forecast.\nSimple Models Are Better Models: Like occam’s razor, the best model is often the one with the least amount of inputs.\nCapture Uncertainty: Showing the back testing results and future uncertainty of a model’s forecast builds more trust.\nModel Averages Are King: Usually a simple average of multiple models is more accurate than just one model’s prediction.\nDeep Learning Last: Deep learning isn’t as effective as more traditional ML models.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but instead principles that I find particularly important when creating a time series forecast. Having a firm understanding of these principles is enough to get the ball rolling on any type of forecast you’re working on. Thankfully, the very same approach I use in my job to do forecasting is open source and freely available through my R forecasting package called finnts. Even if you’ve never done data science or used R before, finnts makes it easy to get off the ground fast without shooting yourself in the foot when dealing with the above principles. Stay tuned for more posts about each principle."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson is something I like to read every few months. Eric was able to take all public content from Naval and put it into one place. I love that idea and think Eric will be successful with many other thought leaders.\nMeet Naval Ravikant: a modern philosopher-entrepreneur and the co-founder of AngelList. Renowned for his deep insights on technology, investing, and the art of living, Ravikant has become a luminary in Silicon Valley. Beyond his success with startups like X (Twitter) and Postmates, he captivates audiences with his profound perspectives on life and happiness, shared on his popular podcast and Twitter feed.\nEnjoy some of Naval’s best quotes and ideas I found most interesting.\n\nTypes of Leverage\n\nLabor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Money is a good form of leverage. It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money. It’s probably been the most dominate form of leverage in the last century.\nCode and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.\n\nFocus on permissionless leverage. Often people think the next step in their career is managing people. That’s how they get more money, more power, more status. Is Taylor Swift Time’s 2023 person of the year because she is a great manager or because she is the best in the world at media (music, video, merch)? We’re quickly starting to see more one person empires being built. Through media with influencer’s, and through code like Satoshi Nakamoto (inventor of Bitcoin). Instead of trying to grow you career through scaling of people and capital, try the route with no gatekeepers.\nBalaji Srinivasan made an interesting point that once a robot can do something, you’ve turned labor into capital. Meaning you just need the money to purchase the robot and then code to program it. Not long from now we might see managers only overseeing physical robots operating in the world of atoms (doing physical work) or AI agents operating in the world of bits (traditional knowledge work). The skills needed to manage these new digital workers revolve around writing code and coordination. Not traditional management skills.\n\n\nBuild or Sell\n\nLearn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\n\nI believe Bill Gates said this back in his heyday at Microsoft. This is the most powerful piece of advice in the book. Most businesses boil down to a product or service to sell. The most important people at a company either build that product or sell that product. If you do not do work like that today at your company, you might want to consider changing jobs. These roles have the greatest potential for impact on the world, and create the most financial rewards.\n\n\nSpecific Knowledge\n\nSpecific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.\n\nThis is how you can prevent AI from taking your job. If what you do can’t be explained in a book, class, or YouTube videos, there is a good chance it will be hard for an AI model to figure out how to do it well.\n\n\nBe You\n\nThe way to get out of the competition trap is to be authentic, to find the thing you know how to do better than anybody. You know how to do it better because you love it, and no one can compete with you. If you love to do it, be authentic, and then figure out how to map that to what society actually wants. Apply some leverage and put your name on it. You take the risks, but you gain the rewards, have ownership and equity in what you’re doing, and just crank it up. Your goal in life is to find the people, business, project, or art that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you. What you don’t want to do is build checklists and decision frameworks built on what other people are doing. You’re never going to be them. You’ll never be good at being somebody else. Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.\n\nNothing to add here, Naval hit the nail on the head.\n\n\nLifelong Learning\n\nThe most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.\n\nChatGPT was released by OpenAI about a year ago. In that time, people have had the opportunity to get up to speed on using generative AI models like GPT-3.5 and now GPT-4. There was no class in using these models, only the documentation on OpenAI’s website and videos on YouTube. For the brave folks who went ahead and learned how to use these models, the world will be theres the next three years while everyone else catches up. Learning how to use GPT-4 in your company to improve a product or become more productive is a form of permissionless leverage. Something of a superpower. The recent AI hype cycle might be winding down, but people with these skills are in demand. A few years from now another technology or idea might come out, another thing that’s not taught in schools. Never stop learning, never stop growing."

It will even come for pure software development jobs. What AI cannot replace in the near term is specialized knowledge, skills that can only be obtained through apprenticeships. In the future, we need to focus more on gaining strong domain expertise across business, science, and engineering. But only in ways where specialized knowledge is needed, not simple skill acquisition that a LLM can do faster and cheaper. Going to a coding bootcamp to learn how to build web apps will help you make money this year at a company, but that same company might kick you to the curb three years from now when GitHub Copilot can code the entire app in a day."

This is a good proxy for how much knowledge someone has to attain before they are qualified to work in a specific job. Doctors and lawyers seem to require the most schooling before they can start their careers. Most likely because of all of the information they have to memorize and load into their head. The more specialized someone’s skills in a domain like medicine, the more money they can make. What’s interesting is that new large language models are becoming very good at the same thing, and can be trained in months, not years. How will this impact these high status, high pay jobs? Specialization will go through a fundamental shift in the age of AI."

    "text": "Story Time\nI recently had to get my knee checked out by a doctor. I tweaked it pretty good playing kickball at my grandma’s 90th birthday party (story for a different time). Most of my time spent getting my knee examined was not actually interacting with the doctor I came to see. Getting checked into the system, filling out forms, getting an xray. All things where the doctor was no where to be found. The doctor did finally come in to my room, after waiting a while, and briefly talked to me for two minutes. Yes, two minutes. Almost as if they couldn’t wait to leave and were in a rush to go somewhere else, maybe the golf course. They recommended I go get an MRI, and handed me a phone number to schedule it myself.\nI went to get the MRI, which was even stranger. It was in a different medical building, one with a waiting room the size of a small bedroom. There were no doctors there, just someone to check you in and someone to operate the MRI machine. After getting the MRI, the technician said I had some bruising on my knee. I asked what that meant and they said they were not a doctor and couldn’t tell me anything about my knee. A qualified doctor was required to do that.\nFinally, after another week I was able to see the doctor again. They looked at the MRI and told me some various technical jargon that meant my knee was ok and that I should just take it easy for another month to heal part of my bone that connects to the knee. This entire process took a month, all to see and speak to a doctor for five total minutes over three appointments. The cherry on top was that it cost me hundreds of dollars even with good insurance. Do you see where I’m going here?"

    "text": "Rethinking Healthcare\nWhat if instead I could go to a local pharmacy, and say that my knee hurts. There could be someone with high tech equipment who could xray my knee, and take an MRI if needed. An AI system would analyze the scans and flag any concerns. I could then get a final recommendation from the system. If something was wrong with my knee, it could recommend some physical therapy exercises. Or if something was really wrong it could route my request to a hospital that could do the surgery for me. This process could happen in an hour, instead of a month, and could cost me half the price without ever needing to see a real doctor. This kind of technology might be closer to reality then some might guess.\n\nDoctors who go to school most of their life could be replaced by a specially trained large language model that was trained on the history of medical research in a few months. It would already know everything about the human body, including what current therapies and medicines work the best. The best part is once it’s built, it can scale to the entire world. Rural villages in India could get the same healthcare as the rich in Beverly Hills.\nWould doctors still need to go to school? There is still an opportunity for wannabe doctors about to enter school. Instead of going to school for seven years, maybe they just jump to the very end of the training from the get go. Instead of building a strong foundation about everything in the body, they skip and go right to the path of specialization in a specific field of medicine. This is how doctors get paid the most anyways. If someone is interested in oncology (treating cancer), then maybe that’s what they start studying immediately. They can use AI tools to cover the basics on everything else and spend all of their waking moments on learning about cancer. Lowering the barriers to entry might make it easier for more folks to do medical research, at least until AI starts to get good at that too.\nIf doctors can be replaced, what happens to nurses? They already do a decent amount of the work already in hospitals, and are the main connection to a patient. Over time they could be the ones powered by AI who end of making all of the decisions and determining the best treatment options. A nurses role would change into a combined version of what doctors and nurses have done historically. Maybe even spawning a new type of job. Robotics is another space where AI can disrupt medicine. Would someone rather be treated by a human, or a machine that comes with 90% less medical bills? Money might do the talking there, but replacing human connection could be the most resistant to AI and automation."

    "text": "AI Cannot Replace Specialized Knowledge\nMemorizing all of the parts of the body and the latest medical research is easily done by LLMs. What could be more difficult is what Naval Ravikant calls specialized knowledge. These are skills that cannot be easily learned from a book or class. Instead they usually get developed through apprenticeships. A student learning from a master, Jedi style. My life in corporate finance is a good example of specialized knowledge. My company hires finance employees from all walks of life. Having a finance degree or experience is good but not crucial to succeeding. This is most likely because the work you actually do within the CFO’s org is very specialized, where what classes you took in school is not that helpful. Most of it, in the financial planning and analysis space, revolves around financial rhythms like forecasting and close. There is no class in college related to this work. You cannot watch a few YouTube videos and get up to speed in a weekend. You learn by doing, and mostly watching others do it. This apprenticeship like model is a powerful indicator of what jobs are hard to replace with AI. There have been efforts to automate things like forecasting with machine learning (ML) in finance, but we have a long way to go before that becomes the default for everyone. Even then there will be cases where a ML model cannot capture everything about a business in its training data, and a human will always need to be in a loop to impart their domain expertise.\nDomain expertise will become more valuable as LLMs can learn more technical concepts like coding and memorizing all facts on the internet. What it can’t do (not yet at least) is know how a specific business works inside and out like a human can. A LLM could write all of the code to build your companies website, but it will not know how to piece together logistics, manufacturing, sales, marketing, and design all at the same time like a CEO can. Maybe one day it will get closer, but for now we still need a human at the top directing all of these AI processes. That takes specialized knowledge."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nIn my current job, I believe strong domain knowledge about finance and our business is going to be way more important than what kind of coding skills you posses. Since LLMs will take over more of the coding tasks, leaving work that requires specialized knowledge for us humans to do. This could mean less specialists in technical domains that historically have paid the most, since that kind of knowledge was rare in society. With more emphasis on specialization for domain specific knowledge is a business instead. Coders who are like restaurant line cooks working their way through a backlog created by someone else might be at the highest risk of getting their jobs removed. Same goes for doctors who just spend five minutes reviewing a patients chart and telling them what to do next without any follow up or long-term investment.\nFinally, if AI can know the foundation of each profession, that makes it easier for anyone to come into the space and do good work. If they are able to obtain specialized knowledge quickly. This opens up opportunities for people to have multiple careers throughout their life, without the need of always going back to school or getting a credential of some type. Over the long term this gives the power to individuals with high agency and entrepreneurial spirit. Ones who can seize opportunities for innovation and make impact across many different domains."

    "text": "When I started learning data science there was an essential choice that had to be made at the beginning. One that has consequences that can ripple throughout your machine learning journey and even change your career options. I’m talking about the classic debate of R versus Python. Just like any hot issue, you will most likely get a different answer to this question based on who you ask. R is great for statistics, but Python is the best for production. You can’t do deep learning in R. Python is the second best language for everything. Over the years it seems that each side of the debate has only dug their heels in deeper. Whenever people ask me what language they should learn first, I usually give this recommendation. If you can only choose one, learn python, but eventually you will have to learn both to be a good data scientist. Building high quality solutions with data comes down to one thing, picking the right tool for the job.\nEach language has its strengths. Over the years the rise of new open source packages have started to even the playing field. For example R has always had amazing packages for time series, but now python is catching up. The same can be said for the rise of deep learning in R. While I still believe learning both will allow you to thrive in your data career, the rise of large language models (LLM) like OpenAI’s Chat-GPT are going to change the game forever.\nIf you haven’t heard of Chat-GPT yet then you are living under a rock, and congrats on being able to read this blog inside your underground doomsday bunker. These LLM’s can do a lot of things, but the game changer for the open source data space is being able to easily translate one language into another. For example I’m able to easily translate dplyr code in R into perfect pandas code in python. Over time these models will unlock the potential to translate every package from one language into another. Imagine writing a package in R, and have a GitHub action that calls a LLM to automatically convert it into python or vice versa. A data scientist could even write code in one language during a projects development, then automatically convert it into another when they move into production. The possibilities are endless!\nModels like Chat-GPT may not be at this level of language translation today, but like anything in the AI space the pace of innovation moves exponentially, and could be on the horizon sooner than you think. I for one personally can’t wait for this day to come."

    "text": "New year, new me, right? Today marks the start of many peoples new year resolutions, or big goals they want to start chasing over the next year. For me I think that’s bad advice. Goals like “get in shape” or “travel more” don’t really mean anything and can easily get set aside as your life autopilot takes over. No wonder why most resolutions get dropped by February. Why do you think you have to sign a bunch of contracts when you join a gym? They know how our default settings work and ensure you’re paying for a while regardless if you come in. In reality, they would appreciate it if you didn’t come in at all. Less of your sweat to mop up.\nInstead I focus on two things, being consistent and trying to map out the next few steps in front of me.\nBeing consistent is what matters in anything you pursue in life. People overestimate what they can accomplish in the next few weeks but underestimate what they can accomplish in a year. Let’s change the resolutions we called out above to instead be more consistent. Instead of “get in shape” we can rephrase that as “exercise 30 min every day”, or “travel more” can be changed to “leave the country once a year” or “get out of my town once a quarter”. These are now measurable things that will keep you honest instead of loftier ones that are easier to sweep under the rug.\nHaving long term goals is another trap I try to avoid. People plan, and God laughs. Having it all figured out is a quick way to getting let down when things don’t exactly go as you planned. Instead I focus on the next 1-3 steps in all aspects of my life. I don’t plan to have 12 pack abs, but rather focus on doing core 3-5 times a week. I don’t plan to be some hot shot director or senior engineer at my job, but rather focus on shipping the next few features on the big projects I work on. I still maintain a vision of the long term aspects of the things I work on in my job, but know that those are subject to change as I actually start to build out the next 1-3 steps.\nIf you are someone who enjoys writing goals, then all power to you. To each their own. For me I have found being consistent in a few things can compound into something special. Why not try it yourself and see where it takes you in 2023."

With quarto you can write Python or R code, and create outputs that can be published anywhere, including as web pages.\nI used to leverage some complex Ruby code with Jekyll to produce this site, but with quarto the process was dramatically simplified. The design of “.qmd” documents is very smooth and intuitive, allowing me to fully re-publish the site on a Sunday afternoon. I still leverage github pages, which connects to a “docs” folder in my repo where the quarto files are rendered as html, css, and javascript. Very simple.\nWith great technology like quarto, it begs the question if folks should use quarto for all written communication. From writing proposals, creating slide presentations, publishing papers, and creating technical documentation. All written as code and stored in version control.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today there are a lot of tools for people to write screenplays. Most of them are paid and require hundreds of dollars. I recently stumbled across a VS Code add called Better Fountain that allows you to turn simple markdown documents into a professionally formatted screenplay. It is built upon an open source tool called Fountain, that is a bare bones screenwriting tool that is free and easy to use.\nWhy the heck would you want to write a screenplay is VS Code? I was asking myself the same thing. If you come from a coding background, this is an easy transition. Heck, I’m writing this post currently in a markdown file within VS Code 😎. What I think is most interesting is the tools we use to code can now be applied to the older art of storytelling with screenwriting.\nThe biggest tool most coders leverage is some sort of version control. VS Code easily integrates with GitHub, so you can push your latest script (screenplay) changes to version control and track their changes with ease. Side note, kinda funny how folks in Hollywood call their screenplays “scripts”. Guess coding and storytelling are more alike then we thought.\nWhat makes the idea of hosting your script on GitHub is how it could be seen by others. It could be a public repository, and essentially open source. An open source movie? That would be crazy. What if others could read the script and make updates through pull requests? It could be the best version of fan fiction. What if others could read the script, upvote it in some way (using GitHub stars) to catch the eyes of top directors and film studios? That way a movie could already be audience approved beforehand.\nThis becomes very interesting when you add in the idea of block chain and smart contracts. If a movie studio wants to pick it up and take it into production, everyone who contributed to the script in the GitHub repo could automatically receive some sort of pre-arranged compensation when the movie gets made. There could even be new types of open source licenses built for these kinds of projects that have specified terms around compensating people who made the project possible.\nThere could also be some kind of crypto coin created for the repo, which would allow movie studios to buy into the project and either fund change requests to the script or set up a subsequent sequel or second season. The possibilities get more exciting the more I think about them.\nTo close this out, let’s list out everything that makes this a horrible idea. The biggest thing that comes to mind is that people don’t want to know what’s going to happen in a movie or tv show. Having the script publicly available somewhere like GitHub could ruin any twists or cliffhangers in a script, but at the same time we run into the same problem today if someone watches a movie anytime after opening day. Everyone knew the plot to Harry Potter before each movie was released, but people lined up around the corner to go watch them anyway. Maybe open source movies are not such a bad thing after all."

The more solutions you want to build, the more resources you need to build them. ML solutions expand on a linear scale. This linear approach runs into a myriad issues.\n\nData scientist teams in other orgs already have a job, and can only offer so much support.\nCosts grow with each new solution. Existing solution work never goes away. There will always be maintenance to constantly update data sources and improve the model as the business evolves. More solutions, more problems.\nPrinciple-Agent problem with vendors. External resources want to make sure they are always needed, which means they will build solutions in a way to ensure new solutions continue to scale linearly. New innovation around scaling solutions or democratization through tools may never come, since that removes them from the picture.\n\nIn addition to scale issues, there is another large problem of domain expertise. Most outside data scientists don’t understand the work of finance people. Those that claim they have experience in building finance solutions do not understand your company and its various nuances. This creates the need for program manager (PM) roles to be created in order to gather the domain expertise of finance users and translate it to these outside resources to build solutions. More layers of abstraction lead to longer dev times, more communication overhead, and just more everything. The linear approach is a short-term solution to a long-term problem.\n\nLeveraging data science talent outside of finance is a short-term solution to a long-term problem.\n\nYou could also entertain the idea of hiring these vendors and other outside talent as full-time employees to sit within the finance department. This might seem to solve some of the problems called out above, but it still doesn’t solve the long-term problem. These outside data scientists turned finance employees may not have finance backgrounds, and in some respects are “data mercenaries”.

Yes, I’m talking about your finance employees! What I’m proposing is to find the data scientists who don’t know they are data scientists yet, the diamonds in the rough.\nThe diamonds I’m talking about usually fit a familiar archetype, which you may have already seen within your finance employees.\n\nLike to build things. They hate repeating themselves, and often take pride in the large financial models they have built in excel. They might already know a little bit of programming, whether that’s excel macros using VBA or having a little python knowledge to break out whenever they feel constrained by the four walls of excel.\nConstantly learning. They are the definition of a growth mindset. Being a “learn it all” is more important than being a “know it all” kind of person.\nMaster communicator. This one is typically harder to find. Having someone who loves to build, and then can turn around and sell it to others is hard to do. Being able to explain complex technical subjects is a super power itself.\n\nIf you send out the bat signal looking for these types of folks, many will come running. Others may be more hesitant to reach out. Imposter syndrome could be the biggest reason these diamonds stay in the rough. They could be a rock star within the org, but they may not see themselves that way. So always be on the lookout for talent, even if they don’t see it in themselves.\nCreating a path from regular finance employee to data scientist is a hard path to build out. This is a problem I have been thinking about for some time, and more details will be provided in a future blog post. At a high level, an apprenticeship program is one that I personally see as a path to building finance centered data science teams. Most of us forgot about this model of learning, and think it’s only for electricians and plumbers today. I think it’s making a comeback in a big way, and look forward to detailing how I plan to implement it within my finance org. The best part is, once I do I will report back with information around how you can do it too!"

There are many pitfalls along the way, and it’s not an easy process. What I hope to do is implement a system for growing data science talent that already exist within finance, then turn around and share those insights with the rest of the world. Stay tuned!"

    "text": "Reversal\n\nFor smaller finance orgs (&lt;50 employees), leveraging outside data science talent may be your best strategy. There are only a few places that ML can be implemented, and having a full time team on-site may not be the best financial decision.\nHiring external data science help as full time employees could work just fine if you find people who are passionate about solving problems within the business. They may not always be data mercenaries and could have existing business backgrounds in addition to data science skills.\nThere has been a lot of innovation recently in no-code tools that enable anyone to produce a machine learning model for a variety of tasks. This democratization leads to more exponential adoption of ML, as opposed to the linear adoption curve. This can post it’s own risks, where cookie cutter solutions don’t fit the need to every problem. Once you do need a more custom solution based on the needs of the business, you are right back at square one in using outside help. Custom solutions and no-code tools will merge into a happy harmony one day, and will intermingle as self-serve solutions need to be transformed into custom ones managed by a data science team.\nIt will take time to grow existing finance talent into data science roles, and it may not work out. There is some downside to this approach, but it comes with potentially unlimited upside when you empower the domain experts to build things they think are useful.\nLack of career path and poor engineering practices are likely to spring up after going down this paths. This is something to think a lot about, and is something I plan to address in a future post around building an apprenticeship program."

The free content just teaches the basics and is a hook for you to continue into a paid course or site. freeCodeCamp to the rescue!\nFCC is a free site to learn many aspects of coding. From web development to cybersecurity. They have courses that teach you in depth about programming, with in the browser coding exercises to help hone your skills. To get a certification for a course or topic, all you need to do is complete the project list on the site. This makes it great for complete newbies, as well as people with some experience who would benefit from the project work and certification.\nMy favorite part of FCC is not the site itself, but instead their youtube page. This in a gold mine of useful tutorials and classes taught by experts in their field. The youtube has so much more content than their site. Safe to say it would take years to go through and watch everything 😍.\nOne last final thing I wanted to call out is the newsletter that Quincy Larson, founder of freeCodeCamp, sends out each week. It’s a fantastic list of learning resources curated from the FCC blog and youtube site. Definitely worth subscribing to."

    "text": "Nowadays there are thousands of courses on the internet, teaching everything from cooking to machine learning with R. Being a self-taught coder myself I started off taking these online courses, but overtime have realized they may not be the best way of learning.\n\nCertifications Over Knowledge\nFor me, traditional schooling techniques do not ensure I master the material or learn anything that will live in my long term memory. What it does ensure is that I will do anything to “check the box” of a certain class and try to get a good grade. Getting a good grade and actually learning the material are two separate things in these environments.\nGetting a good grade entails learning only what is required to pass some test to prove you learned. This is a dangerous game because there are various ways for students to learn as little as possible and still ace a test or exam. What do these tests prove? Mostly that you can regurgitate facts and equations on command. I think we have all been in a situation where we studied just enough to cover what’s going to be on the exam, then a week after the test all of that knowledge seeps out through our ears. Forever lost.\nThe same can be said about online courses that offer “certifications”. This creates the same attitude as regular classes you may have already taken in high school and college. Knowing just enough to get by and get the class credit, or in this case, a certification. The crazy thing about certifications though is that they don’t show how well you did in the course, only that you passed. That’s like seeing a college transcript with only pass/fail grades instead of a GPA.\n\n\nPrioritizing Just in Time Learning\nGetting out of the “certification learning mode” has been critical to my development in programming and data science. What I have realized is the importance of applying whatever I’m learning to real world projects as soon as possible. Here is the learning loop I follow.\n\nLearn enough foundational concepts to be dangerous\nImmediately apply the knowledge to a real world project\nRefer back to learning materials as needed to reinforce concepts\nGo further down the learning rabbit hole with advanced concepts to improve project\nRinse and repeat above steps to constantly reinforce topics and improve project\n\nThis kind of just in time learning has been amazing for me. It’s allowed me to quickly ramp up on the basics and reinforce them in my brain by working on things in my job that actually matter. Not just some fake project within a course, but something that actually effects my job where the stakes are higher. Then after I get the hang of the basics I go back to the learning well to learn more advanced concepts to then come back and apply within the same real world project.\n\n\nReversal\nThe downside to approaching skill acquisition like this is that there is no fancy diploma or certification you can hang on your wall or post on LinkedIn. What you do have is real work on projects you can hang your hat on. These projects may be specific to your job, meaning you may not be able to share them publicly as proof that you know something. This is where the challenge arises. Sites like LinkedIn are working towards creating ways to show that you have a particular skill via online skill assessments, but this still falls back into the learning enough to check the box approach. Building a solution portfolio that lives publicly on places like GitHub is a great way to show employers you have certain skills, but takes extra time since the solutions you build would have to be outside of your job work.\nOne potential solution that’s the best of both worlds is to write blogs about what you’re working on, without spilling any company secrets, and publishing open source software that allows your work to scale to others. That way others can see your growth and commitment to learning, while also reaping the benefits of your work. Truly a win-win."

A lot of times we have to learn how best to work with others the hard way, through trial and error to see what works.

That’s when I get my best thinking done, and the code flies out of my little meat fingers. I try to have multiple 90 to 120 min blocks of uninterrupted time for deep work. This is crucial to me getting any substantial work done in a day. I guard this time with my life."

This means any urgent email or teams message may not get seen until the early afternoon. If there truly is an emergency and you need to get a hold of me, please call me through teams directly. That way I have to answer and break my deep work flow. Just make sure it’s a true emergency that cannot wait.\nUsually email and IM are the best ways to contact me. For email I try to respond within 1-3 days, and for IM within 24 hours (usually same day). Sending me an IM with just “hey” is usually not my favorite message to receive. If you have a question or request, then say it right out of the gate when sending a message. This will help me prioritize what you’re asking over other things I’m working on that day.\nSomething I’m trying to find good solutions for is the dreaded “do you have a min for a quick call”? I know sometimes just asking a question out loud or sharing your screen is the quickest way to figure something out, but it can rob any flow or attention from the person being asked. So I only try to do this sparingly with others on my team and hope others do the same with me."

    "text": "Dev vs Meeting Days\nI love the idea from Paul Graham about a maker vs manager schedule. Basically it states that even a single meeting can throw off any momentum or flow one might have when building things. It could take more than an hour to get ramped up into a specific coding task, and one 30 minute meeting in the middle of the afternoon can totally derail and developer productivity after the meeting.\nThis has caused me to segment my days in two ways. First, on Monday/Wednesday/Friday I block out my calendar entirely. These are my dev days, where I only focus on writing code and deep thinking. Then my Tuesday/Thursdays are wide open for anyone to schedule meetings with me. I have found this to work very well. Usually when I meet a new person and hear the words “I’ll set up some time to chat”, I immediately tell them that Tuesday/Thursday are usually the best days for me. It’s been hard to keep this kind of schedule, especially for meetings that have a lot of people attached to them where finding open calendar spots is next to impossible. There are cases where I make an exception and meet with people on my dev days, but this is only after asking the organizer if it’s imperative that I come to the meeting. I have learned that a lot of the times I can skip and catch up with folks later.\nSaying no to meeting requests has been a long journey for me, and I’m now getting to the point where I don’t feel like a total jerk declining meetings where I would just be a fly on the wall. What a weight off my shoulders."

    "section": "Asynchronous by Default",
    "text": "Asynchronous by Default\nI love the idea of asynchronous communication. Less meetings, more documentation and long form writing. I think a lot of times people schedule meetings to think through something rather than reflecting on their own and coming up with a solution before sharing it with others. Scheduling a meeting to “think” about a problem or project is a huge waste of everyone who attended the meeting. It’s also selfish.\nHaving everyone come together to discuss something should not be the first option in my opinion. I think personal reflection and writing your thoughts down before sharing with others is much better. It helps clarify your thinking and prevents groupthink from seeping into decisions. Thinking about a problem, writing down possible solutions with thorough analysis, then sharing the results with team members asynchronously is a much better use of everyone’s time then just having a meeting where no preparation is done beforehand. You could still have a meeting to discuss the written document but usually I only like to do that if there are certain components you’d like to debate about what was written of if a final decision needs to be made.\nAs more teams realize the power of distributed teams, asynchronous communication and writing skills will become an even bigger superpower. Doing this well not only makes better use of everyone’s time, but allows for better decisions to be made. More people have the opportunity to voice their opinion, especially introverts. More people have the freedom to work when they want to work, preventing the dreaded 4pm Friday meeting 😪."

    "text": "Best Times to Meet\nThe best times I like to meet are at the edges of existing components of my day. For example, I’d rather meet right after my lunch break around 1:00/1:30pm then having a meeting a 2:30pm. Having a meeting in the middle of the afternoon splits that part of the day in half, which can limit the amount of deep work I get get in a day since it takes a while to get in the zone or flow state. That’s ok because I have set up days (Tue/Thu) where I batch all my meetings together. So if I have a bunch of meetings, all with half hour gaps in between, I don’t worry because I know the next day I’ll have a lot of unstructured time for deep work.\nWith that being said, normally I like meetings to start after 10:30am, take a break over the noon lunch hour, then end by 4pm. Thankfully I work on a team and company that respects those hours, but on occasion I have a 4pm meeting I just can’t avoid. Meeting with a CVP for example. Not the end of the world."

If I even get flustered or seem super stressed, normally time to myself is the cure. Either just some quiet reflection at my desk or a quick walk around the block.\nI’m an introvert so sometimes too many meetings and deadlines can get the best of me and stress me out too much, solitude is the brain reboot I need to come back down to normal."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nI think more people should write about how they work best. Obviously not everyone will have the same working style as other team members, but knowing how someone honestly likes to get their work done helps find common ground and make compromises to get the best collaboration.\nI could even see HR products like Microsoft Viva coming into the mix soon with some type of employee bio or baseball card with high level stats on who they are and how they do their work. Aggregating this kind of info across teams could lead to some interesting insights. If everyone on the team likes to email and IM vs having a meeting to discuss, then maybe the boss should stop scheduling weekly in person update meetings. The same goes for a team that is mostly extroverted and likes to meet in person to work things through. If a new introvert who enjoys asynchronous work joins the team, maybe the team members could create ways to accommodate their working style to find the best of both worlds. Like recording a meeting and allowing them to contribute on their own time instead of joining synchronously. By doing this more teams will become more inclusive, and hopefully more productive. Which is a buzzword every management team loves to hear."

    "title": "Three Levels of Machine Learning Adoption in Finance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Growing machine learning adoption in your finance org is tough. There are many levels to clear, with final bosses to beat. This happens most in aspects of finance that are already being done manually by humans, like forecasting (time series). Below are the three questions or “levels” you need to clear before any company can truly leverage machine learning to its full potential in finance for forecasting.\n\nIs the ML forecast as or more accurate than the current process?\nCan you explain the number generated by the black box?\nIf ML forecasted $100, but actuals came in at $110, how do we explain the forecast variance?\n\nEach level needs to be fully cleared before you can tackle the next. Let’s dive in.\n\nFirst Level\nThe first level is pretty straight forward, you know what the accuracy bar is for the existing process, and in most cases you can create a machine learning forecast that can beat it. Even if you reach a similar level of accuracy with the ML process, ML can run in 95% less time than the manual process. Even then that can be a win for your finance team.\n\n\nSecond Level\nNow you’ve built a machine learning process with great results. This is often where you will face the most resistance from your finance team. They will say “oh great the forecast is super accurate, but how do I know how it came up with its number?”. This is tougher than just creating an accurate forecast, since there is often a trade off between building the most accurate model and building the most interpretable one. Thankfully this is a hot area of research right now, with lots of great open source tools being released. The big key to interpretable forecasts for finance tasks is to understand the seasonality and trend of your forecast, and also how outside drivers (macro, internal KPIs) effect your forecast. Your CFO might not care that your model is mostly driven by historical growth rates over the last 2-3 years but telling her that a key driver in your model is the rise of interest rates and lowering consumer sentiment is a great way to tell a story around the forecast and get more people bought in.\n\n\nThird Level\nThis is the final boss. This in uncharted territory because no data scientist or researcher is thinking about how their models impact the FP&A process at a company. This is a process specific to finance and one that doesn’t have a clear answer. If algorithms can be used to look into the future, then they could also be used to look into the past. Knowing how to automatically reconcile what was initially forecasted versus what actually happened would be a game changer. Allowing you to potentially automate much of the traditional close process in your finance team. Being able to explain the initial ML forecast in level two will allow you to eventually see the factors that contribute to the forecast variance during close.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI think about each one of these questions every single day. Open source tools that my team are working on, like Finn, are being actively improved to answer each one of these questions. If you’re interested in using these tools at your company or helping to make them even better, please reach out to me on LinkedIn."

    "title": "Total Addressable Market for Advanced Analytics in Finance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What would you say, you do here? I often have to explain the buzzword term “advanced analytics” and why exactly does a team like that exist in finance. Shouldn’t we just be called a business intelligence team or data team? The reason my advanced analytics team exists can be boiled down to one sentence. To reinvent how we use new technology to look forward, look backward, and make the next best decision in finance. This one phrase has a lot of surface area, so let’s peel back the onion and dive deeper.\nThe first two buckets cover most activities related to rhythm of business (RoB) work that is so crucial to finance, from budgeting and forecasting to the close process. This contains the bulk of the opportunity or addressable market. The final frontier is helping finance teams make the next best decision, which takes up every other activity outside of the traditional RoB activities.\n\nLooking Forward\nBy definition finance tries to make decisions about the future. What will out revenue look like? How is headcount going to change over the next 12 months? Are we going to actually hit our budget numbers for Q3? Most of looking forward is about some sort of time series forecasting. This is where I think the biggest bang for buck lies in the finance space. Most finance teams need some sort of prediction about the future, and most predictions are time related.\n\n\nLooking Backward\nAfter making predictions about the future, we have to measure what actually happened in the business. This is the “close process” you might hear finance pros discuss (sometimes with distaste). At the end of each month, each quarter, each fiscal year the financial numbers for that period need to lock. Journal entries need to complete, allocations have to be allocated, and every metaphorical “i” is dotted and “t” is crossed. This is probably the most manual process in finance today that hasn’t changed much since the inception of spreadsheets and powerpoint. Human beings have to look at reports, see how the month closed and if that number was different then what was initially forecasted, and then go tell their CFO why we were off $100 or $1,000,000,000 that month. As we use algorithms to look into the future, we can use algorithms to look into the past. If ML can be adopted in the forecast process, then there is a good chance we can use it during close. This is a unique problem to solve though. Currently we can get decent interpretability of the future forecast, but understanding the error between the forecast and what actually happened is not an exact science. I also think it’s a problem most data scientists may not think about today since it might only be important in small niches like finance where explaining that forecast error is crucial and prevents adoption of ML solutions. Large language models I think can unlock this problem, where we can build agents that can peel back the layers of forecasts and run the variance analysis to create the explanations we need. This takes a very manual process and could eventually speed up the story gathering part of close from a few days to a few minutes. Very exciting.\n\n\nMaking the Next Best Decision\nThis is the final frontier for advanced analytics in finance. Outside of the financial RoB processes like forecast and close, finance people do so much other kinds of work that mostly revolve around making data informed decisions about what to do in the business. How should we price our new product? Will the new product hurt sales of our older products? What’s the lifetime value of our customer? Should we buy back shares or double down on R&D? All of these questions cannot fit into a standard time series forecasting bucket, or any standard ML bucket. Each question has its own nuance and needs to be approached in a different way. One way to solve this with technology it to add armies of data & AI professionals who can answer these non-standard questions on demand, but this method doesn’t scale. Finance is notorious for running lean and being reluctant to add large technical teams that don’t do standard BI work like data pipelines and reporting. So again this is a space that is ripe for disruption through large language models. Again it’s agents to the rescue. Agents that can piece together various tools that can find data, pull data, and then analyze that data to help a human make a decision faster and with more precision. We are still so early in this space.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAdvanced analytics in finance still has so much promise yet to be realized. Expectations are high and skeptics are always there. Brick by brick we get closer to making these ideas become a reality. If you are working on machine learning in your finance org, I salute you! It’s often nerve racking work that doesn’t always pay off immediately. Stay at it my friends, and the future will be yours."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On new years day of 2015, I got an email from a Microsoft recruiter to schedule a phone screen for Microsoft’s Finance Rotation Program (FRP). A week after the phone screen, I was reading the book The Alchemist during a study break and started to think about my personal legend. I thought Microsoft would be a good opportunity and hoped for another interview. That’s right when my phone rang, it was the recruiter informing me that I was about to be chosen for the final super day in February. The weekend before the big interview in Redmond, my brother got me tickets to see the Oklahoma City Thunder take on the LA Clippers, a present for my 21st birthday. I told him I couldn’t go, because I needed time to prepare for the biggest interview of my life. Laughing, he said I had nothing to worry about, I would get the job, and we can use this weekend to celebrate the new job. His confidence in me, and the uncanny coincidence with the Alchemist book, were the “omens I’d follow” into my own personal legend. Thankfully the interview went well, I got the offer, and the rest is history.\nThe Finance Rotation Program at Microsoft is a two year program where recent college graduates complete four rotations across various groups in finance, each lasting six months. It’s a great opportunity to learn about different parts of Microsoft’s business, while also being a world class “try it before you buy it” experience for finding your optimal career path. You get to find what your destined to do, and Microsoft gets a well rounded finance professional that is tuned to find the exact job they want long term. A true win-win.\nI often get asked to talk about my experience from would be FRP’s still in school and existing FRP’s in the program. My career path in the FRP is nontraditional in nature, but is hopefully one anyone with enough high agency can do as well. I write this to those high agency folks. People who want to do interesting things in the world and help others. What follows is my path in the FRP and what I recommend for today’s FRP’s."

    "title": "Thoughts on My Journey in Microsoft’s Finance Rotation Program",
    "section": "Rotations",
    "text": "Rotations\n\nInternship: Venture Integration\nI came into the FRP as an intern in the summer of 2015, the same summer Microsoft launched Windows 10. It was a fun time to join finance at Microsoft. Satya Nadella was only installed as CEO a few years back, same as Amy Hood the CFO. The stock price was in the 40s and no one thought Microsoft was doing anything cool or exciting. Safe to say most students at my college had MacBooks instead of Surfaces.\nThe Venture Integration team was responsible for helping acquired companies integrate successfully into Microsoft. While Corporate Development teams work on closing the deal, the Venture Integration team does everything else. From doing due diligence on the companies financial statements, digging through the products source code, all the way to determining if the acquired CEO would move to Redmond. It was a cool space to be in. Code names were used for each deal, and the deal flow was strong. Often we started a new deal every two weeks.\nMy role on the team didn’t involve running deals, although I did get to help with modeling the integration costs for one deal. I was tasked with running the quarterly scorecard process. This involved a lot of cat herding. For each recently closed deal, I would track down metrics to see if we were on track for a successful integration into Microsoft. This was more project management and less about financial modeling or analysis. The cool part was on the last day of my internship I completed the scorecard powerpoint and personally sent it to the CFO for review, who would then share it with the board of directors. So, in a way, I got to work on something that Bill Gate’s got to see. Most likely it was buried in the appendix of the board materials but I know my guy Bill loves to read! So I’m sure he saw it and was blown away by my excellence. At least that’s what I tell myself.\nThe life changing moment for me happened towards the end of the summer. The tech team responsible for reviewing the code of acquired companies hosted a brown bag lunch session about a new service called “Azure Machine Learning Studio”. They demoed a drag and drop tool that could build a machine learning model to predict if an event was going to happen or not. With a few clicks of their mouse they had a working model up and running in a self-serve UI. Only a few lines of code were written, with most of the magic happening in predefined lego blocks they pieced together. My mind was blown. It seemed like a magic trick to me, and I had to figure out how they did it. In school I always loved building three statement financial models to value a companies stock price. The biggest assumption we had to make was around future revenue growth, and that number was always made up. You could say xyz company’s revenue will continue to grow 10% because of xyz reason, but in the end it was a guess. The fact that you could build a machine learning model to create a more accurate prediction of the future was astounding to me, and I had to learn more.\nWithin a week after that presentation, all of the FRP interns got to meet with the CFO. A lot of questions were asked. I’m not even sure who asked it but a question around AI was brought up. Amy said that AI and machine learning will become very important in finance one day, and it will be an important skill for everyone to know. There are few moments of pure clarity in a lifetime where everything comes together and makes perfect sense. This was one of those moments for me. I had to figure out this AI thing. I had absolutely no clue how to start. I was only a finance major with zero technical skills. What I lacked in hard skills I made up for with enthusiasm to go figure it out any way possible.\nThe internship ended and thankfully I got the return offer. I remember the head of the FRP looking at my manager during the final review meeting. She said, “should you tell him or should I tell him”. My heart dropped, I thought I messed up and wasn’t getting the offer. Thankfully that confusion was cleared up real fast and I had a return offer in my hand. How can I say no to an opportunity to come back to Microsoft? Within a week back at school I accepted the offer and had total peace of mind going into my final year of undergrad.\n\n\nFirst Rotation: Windows COGS\nMy first rotation was a classic rhythm of business (ROB) rotation in the world of Windows, Microsoft’s oldest business. It was a great place to earn my sea legs in traditional FP&A work. I was responsible for owning the royalty portfolio for “codec” payments. Basically there is special software needed to read/write disks that are inserted into an optical drive on a computer. That software comes from companies like Dolbe, and Microsoft had to pay them to license the software on Windows OS. Wow, that makes me sound old. Working on royalties for optical drives on computers. Safe to say no one even thinks about optical drives anymore.\nIt wasn’t the prettiest work, but it helped me learn the basics of closing the books each month and forecasting the future each quarter. I had to submit journal entries and make manual adjustments to our payments when needed. Once you got the hang of pulling the data and making journal entries, the work wasn’t all that hard. So most of my time toward the end of the rotation was spent trying to automate every single part of the ROB process. What was initially a complex refresh process handed to me at the start of my rotation was transformed into a simple click to refresh excel that did all of the heavy lifting for you. It was my pride and joy.\nMy manager gave me a powerful piece of feedback towards the end of the rotation. He said that I liked building things. Some people like to start things, others like to keep a process going or optimize it. I was someone who liked to build new things. That idea stuck with me. I eventually became the guy on the team who could build any complex workflow as a model in excel. For example building out the new forecast consolidation file that all team members could add their component forecasts into. While it was fun to build this kind of stuff, it wasn’t AI work. For that I had to continue on my data hero’s journey.\n\n\nSecond Rotation: Worldwide Commercial Solutions Finance\nFor my second rotation I wanted to leave the world of ROB behind and get my hands dirty with data. I went to a team that did two things. First was analytics around discounts and customer renewals across Microsoft’s commercial business, and the second was around supporting the financing of customer purchases. Back in the day a customer could finance a large software purchase so they didn’t have to pay for most of it up front. We would partner with a bank to finance the payment or even do the financing ourselves through our Treasury department.\nThis rotation was all around analytics, which was exactly what I needed. I was able to analyze patterns around the type of discounts we give to customers, and how those discounts compound as a customer continues to renew their software purchase contracts. Another big ticket analytics item was around tracking special azure financing deals. This was a key metric we reported directly to the CFO, so a lot of eye balls were on it. I was the guy to track down this data and create interesting ways to understand it.\nPower BI was recently released. No one on the team knew how to use it, but understood how powerful it could be when visualizing data. So I became the Power BI guy on the team. The one to figure out how to use it, then teach it to everyone else. Thankfully the previous FRP started them on the Power BI journey by building some initial dashboards. My job was to improve those dashboards, then get everyone else up to speed on how they could build their own. It was a solid experience in the world of analytics. One where no one could show you how to solve certain problems. You were on your own and had to figure everything out yourself.\nThe analytics experience was great, but still no AI. While on the team I tried to find ways we could apply AI and machine learning to specific areas but couldn’t find a good opportunity. At this point I started to learn more on my own through books and courses on the internet. I was flying blind, with no one to guide me to ensure I was headed in the right direction. That’s when the power of serendipity came and altered the course of my FRP career.\nAnother FRP analyst in my class got her last pick on her list of ranked rotations. Like choice number 32 out of 32 options. Right before she started on her team for the second rotation, there was a large re-org and she was able to now chose wherever she’d like to go in the broader org. A true choose your own adventure. She had an information systems background and found a team that was just starting to get into the world of machine learning. I heard about this and knew exactly where I wanted to go for my third rotation.\n\n\nThird Rotation: Finance Business Intelligence Services\nWorking for the FBI, what a fun thing to say. The FBI Services team was almost an in house consultancy team, who supported most folks in finance. If someone wanted a special dashboard, custom tool, or even machine learning model they could reach out to this team and get the help they needed. The team consisted mostly of program manager (PM) type roles for full time employees, and various technical roles for vendors.\nComing to this team was being at the right place at the right time. In the summer of 2015 (during my internship) our CFO reached out to the head of the cloud engineering team, asking him to help get some initial machine learning solutions off the ground. Eventually this work was transferred to the FBI Services team, who hired a team of data science vendors to keep the work going. Most of the ML solutions centered around time series forecasting, since that is easily the biggest bang for buck ML work in the corporate finance space. Almost everyone under the CFO is responsible for some sort of forecast, so the impact with ML is enormous.\nI came on the team as a PM who would partner with the data science vendors to build ML solutions. It was a dream come true. Finally I had people I can talk to about ML. Pick their brain. See how they think about ML problems. I also found a data science certification offered through Microsoft (on the EdX learning platform). It had a full learning track for python, no coding experience required. Thankfully as a Microsoft employee I could take the courses for free. While on the team I was able to make the learning part of my job, and even devote part of each day to taking the courses. It was a dream come true.\nThe big project on the team was around creating a centralized tool for our finance teams in the field, teams who support sales and sit all around the world, to use for their quarterly forecast of the commercial business. We were tasked with building a tool that could combine machine learning methods with existing sales pipeline based methods (like taking what’s in the sales pipeline and multiplying it by how many deals we have closed on average historically). One tool that everyone in the field could use instead of building their own manual excel model that eats up weeks of their time every forecast cycle.\nIt was a fun project to work on. The stakes were high, and no one had done anything like it before. It wasn’t just a machine learning project, but also a centralization and automation project. A crazy ven diagram of categories of technology. Over the course of my six month rotation we (and I say that lightly since I was the rookie on this project) were able to go from initial concept to working plugin in excel that could automatically calculate the forecast for the user, allow them to select what forecast methods they’d like to use, make any manual adjustments, and save that data back to a data cube. A herculean effort that had a few late nights toward the end of the project. It was a fantastic learning experience, with so many different opportunities to learn in one project. How to work with technical and non-technical people. Getting the most from ML models, and knowing their limitations. The change management required to get to people to want to use the new tool and move away from what they’ve always done.\nI was also able to knock out the entire Microsoft certification in data science. I could now write python code to analyze data, train models, and create predictions. Everything that astounded me as an intern was now in my tool kit. I had data super powers and it felt awesome. The only problem is I had no idea what came next. Towards the end of the rotation I wanted to stay on the team and graduate early. Unfortunately the previous FRP was able to secure a full time spot on the team before I asked. Now I was in a tough spot. Knowing what I wanted to do, but not knowing where to do it. Thankfully serendipity came to my rescue.\nAt a FRP manager round table, my manager noted to the group that I was looking for a home for my fourth and final rotation. I wanted to work on machine learning but had no clue what team to rank highly. Another manager spoke up, saying they were just starting to dip their toes in the ML space and could have me on the team. That chance encounter lead me to ranking that rotation as my number one pick. Other FRP’s thought I was crazy. Usually that rotation went to a first year FRP, often as someone’s first rotation. I saw it as an opportunity to work on a technical team and carve out a path to working full time on ML. Safe to say after I joined the team every FRP who has worked on the team since has been a second year analyst.\n\n\nFourth Rotation: Office/Dynamics/Bing Business Intelligence\nMy final rotation was a BI team that supported finance teams in the Office, Dynamics, and Bing product spaces. Previous FRP’s worked on an executive scorecard that would get sent to senior leaders. I had my fill of scorecards while an intern so I was relieved that they were changing the rotation to allow me to work on machine learning problems. I felt like the luckiest guy in the world. I could actually write code to build machine learning models and get paid for it, all without having a degree in the subject.\nI worked on two main projects while on the team. One was around forecasting search traffic volume for our Bing business partners, and another was focused on trying to predict if a potential customer purchase in our sales pipeline was going to close or not. The search volume project was exciting because I could write code from scratch to create the forecasts. It was my first true ML project that I was responsible for coding. Building something from nothing, it was exhilarating. Just like my first rotation manager said.\nThe second project was a tough one. Being able to create a classification model to predict the likelihood of a deal in our customer sales pipeline closing was a tricky project. One where getting high quality historical data was tough to get. I knew this was something analytics teams in sales had to of tried to solve before, so I sent out the bat signal through a few distribution groups and got a hit. A data science team in India had done the exact work I needed and could send me the results of their models prediction. What should have taken months of work was now widdled down to a few weeks to pull the prediction data and display it in a Power BI. Leveraging the work of others proved a powerful lesson for me, and allowed me to finish my project that much faster.\nMy time on the team flew by and I was quickly approaching the end of my FRP tenure, meaning I needed to find a full time job ASAP. Most of my time quickly shifted to checking internal job boards and emailing managers in other BI teams, hoping they had a spot for me. I wanted this ML train to keep rolling. My current team said that they could potentially offer me a job, but I had to wait a little longer. This did little to remove any fear of not finding a job post FRP graduation. FRP’s were given some flexibility in finding a full time job. After graduating the program in September, Microsoft gave you about 4-6 weeks more to settle into a final job. You would still get paid, even if you didn’t have a team to call home. Being in this corporate limbo sounds nice in theory but in reality is awful. Like your days are numbered.\nThe waiting ended in a re-org of another BI team joining ours. So there was a hiring freeze in the meantime while both teams were being combined. After that, a job was offered, and the rest is history. I’m still on that team today. We’ve been through a lot of re-orgs since 2018, but I still get to work on ML every single day. I consider myself lucky."

    "title": "Thoughts on My Journey in Microsoft’s Finance Rotation Program",
    "section": "Advice",
    "text": "Advice\nHere is my advice for anyone interested in the FRP, currently in the program, or FRP’s who are about to graduate and start the next phase of their career. I have to say that this advice may not stand the test of time, hiring practices constantly change. So take these next words with a grain of salt.\n\nAspiring FRP’s\nRecruiting for the FRP used to be done at target schools. Places like Texas, Penn, and the University of Washington. Kids from these schools normally had the best shot at getting an interview, because Microsoft would come onto campus and do interviews. Thankfully this started to change when I applied for the internship. Now Microsoft finds FRPs from any school in the country, even recently expanding to other parts of the world. This opens up the opportunity of joining the FRP to almost anyone in the world, but because of this it becomes harder to get recognized in a sea full of applications.\nBefore you even apply, you need to put yourself in a strong position by building a portfolio of experiences and skills that make you a perfect match for the FRP. Here is what I recommend.\n\nHigh Agency: Having good grades is a fantastic accomplishment, but nowadays everyone has good grades. It becomes more of a check box than something that differentiates yourself from others. Grades show that you can follow instructions, keep deadlines, and demonstrate some type of understanding of your study area. What companies want though are people who go out into the world and make things happen. People who are proactive instead of reactive, or better put have high agency. The best definition I’ve heard of high agency is “a person you would call to bail you out of a third world prison”. Someone who can do that can most likely figure out how to do any kind of job, and become indispensable to their company. The best way to showcase high agency to recruiters at Microsoft is to show how you spend your time outside of the classroom. If you have a 4.0 but only play video games when you’re not studying, your resume will most likely get thrown away. Don’t get me wrong, you could be a fantastic hire but a recruiter has no idea how you get along with others, your communication skills, or anything that’s not related to reading a textbook and taking a test to prove you read the textbook. The best way to showcase high agency is with leadership experience. Running your own business, being the vice president of your sorority, treasurer of your finance club, running your own charity, working a full time job to pay for school. These are all ways to demonstrate that you are someone who goes out and makes things happen. That you indeed have high agency.\nPrevious Work Experience: Having already done the job makes it easy to get a similar job. This can sometimes be a chicken or the egg situation, where needing a previous job to get your first job isn’t possible. That’s why I think you should start small. For me, it started the summer after 8th grade. I got a job in the concession stand of my local city pool. It wasn’t fun work, but lead to my second job working for the famous Jack Stack BBQ in the catering department. That job lead to multiple summers working at two different golf courses as a cart boy. All to say that it eventually lead to my first real business job working as an intern on Fridays during the school year at a financial advisor company. I didn’t do much, but I showed up every Friday ready to help. Having that experience gave me the opportunity to work in FP&A at HR&R Block in Kansas City as a legit intern. That experience then opened the door to work at Microsoft as an FRP intern. Small beginnings lead to massive results. Having a crap job at the beginning can lead to your dream job later down the line. Start this path as soon as you can, because hard work compounds.\nData Superpowers: In this modern age of AI, knowing how to work with data is critical. I’m not just talking excel skills. Being able to pull, manipulate, visualize, and tell stories with data is most of what you do in Finance at Microsoft. Having some programming or low code skills in data tools like python or Power BI can go a long way. This gets supercharged with tools like ChatGPT, where a little knowledge of coding can quickly make you on par with an entry level data scientist or software engineer. Imagine not learning email or Microsoft Office in the 90s. Not knowing email today is basically a firable offense. Using AI powered tools might have the same path in knowledge work. Get ahead and get data superpowers.\n\nYou might have all of those experiences and skills called out above, but that’s only half the battle. You still have to get noticed somehow. Either by a recruiter or someone else who works at the company. Here is what I recommend.\n\nConferences: Microsoft has pivoted away from on campus interviews and now does a lot of recruiting at conferences. This is how the first round of interviews get offered. These conferences are usually meetings of large student organizations like Association of Latino Professionals for America (ALPFA), Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), Out for Undergrad (O4U), and National Association of Black Accountants (NABA).\nEmployee Referral: Getting your resume referred by a current or FRP alum can go a long way, but it’s no guarantee of an interview. The best way to get a referral is by actually knowing someone who works at the company, or having a shared interest with them. Blindly messaging Microsoft employees on LinkedIn could work, but you’d have better success finding someone who went to your same high school or served in the same branch of the military. Having a shared connection around a place or thing helps.\nIntern First: The best way to get a full time offer is to be an intern the summer before. 50-90% of full time FRP’s were an intern the previous summer. This is the path with the greatest opportunity of a job. Don’t go work at a bank in the summer, assuming you’ll get a shot at Microsoft in the fall if you don’t like your bank job. Be in it to win it from the start.\n\n\n\nCurrent FRP’s\nFor folks currently in the FRP, I hope you’re having just as much fun as I did. Normally when working with FRP’s today I have to fight the urge to grab them around the shoulders and beg them to cherish being in the FRP (just like Billy Madison). In order to get the most out of the program you should do the following.\n\nAlways ask for what you want. The biggest unlock I learned in the FRP is to just be up front with what you want in the rotation. Telling your manager at the beginning of the rotation what you’d hope to get out of the next six months can unlock doors you never thought possible. In my fourth rotation, they literally changed the entire rotation because I simply asked if I could solely work on building ML solutions. Don’t forget I’m still working in that job six years later. The best approach is to ask for what you want before you rank your next rotation. Bear in mind you can’t just say something like “I want to work with the CFO directly”. I’ve seen interns do this in the past, and it doesn’t end well for them. Know what you want, have some sort of skill or experience doing it, then ask for it.\nAlways see who else is working on something first. It’s always fun to build something from scratch. An important skill to learn in the FRP though is building on the work of others. This is a key component of how impact gets measured at the company. In my fourth rotation, I was able to have impact 10x as fast on the deal pipeline analysis project because I found another data scientist team who already had a deal pipeline conversion model I could leverage and start using immediately. If I didn’t ask I would have spent most of my time trying to build one, which may not have been useful at all. Always ask around before building something new.\nEmbrace serendipity. Your career path is never going to work out 100% exactly like you planned it, and you don’t want it to. You need to brace serendipity, keeping an open mind for making the most of new opportunities. The best example was the FRP in my class who got their dead last choice of rotation, but ended up working on that team full time post FRP. You never know where a road is going to take you. Don’t be afraid to explore different paths or see things through on an existing path.\n\n\n\nGraduating FRP’s\nMy last piece of advice comes to those who are ending their FRP tenure and now look on to the rest of their career. It can be a scary feeling, so here’s what I recommend.\n\nCast a wide net. Don’t just apply to one job, hoping you’re going to get it and end up with the perfect job. You need to apply to a crap ton of jobs. Don’t be picky. Even apply to jobs that don’t look exciting on paper, because that could change once you meet with the hiring manager. Serendipity could strike in your favor.\nThe best jobs go to people with high agency. Your perfect job is out there, but it may not be listed on the internal company job board. So have high agency and chase down opportunities that don’t even exist yet. This starts months before graduation. You need to network with teams you are interested in, meeting with potential hiring managers who could one day give you a job. For me, I went to every business intelligence team in finance. I emailed the director level leader, gave my short sales pitch saying I wanted do work on ML solutions for their team, and asked if we could chat to discuss any openings on their team. I’d even ask them if they knew any other team I should go talk to. Most didn’t offer me a job. Some continued to offer me interviews years after the FRP. You just never know. If you are talking to teams that aren’t hiring, you are basically in your own talent pool. Looking for opportunities that might materialize later once you graduate. If a job does open on that team, who is their first call? Probably the person who proactively reached out and made a connection well before a job was ever created. Use this to your advantage.\nJoin for the team, not the job. The job will eventually come. Being in the right position is important more than what you do. Most jobs after graduating may not be the most fun. They will be work, maybe even grueling. Someone needs to do the work and congrats it’s your turn to eat a plate of crap for the company. Going to the right team is definitely more important that getting the dream job you wanted on a crap team. For me, I took a job on my fourth rotations team. They said I could do ML work, but most of my time would be spent as a program manager (PM). I hated PM work, but knowing that part of my time could be doing ML work was all I needed to hear. Eventually my job morphed into 100% ML work after I was able to prove to my manager that I could have more impact on the ML side than the PM side of my job. Being on the right team or org allows you more opportunity to work on things you eventually want your career to morph into. The team I joined post FRP has now morphed into a 400+ person engineering team. One that’s quickly becoming the defacto engineering team in finance at Microsoft. Being on this team over the years has created much more opportunity compared to doing similar work on a different team. Thankfully I was well positioned, even though I didn’t have the ideal job initially. See what I mean? So don’t be too picky on the job, but more picky on the team."

How to ramp up quickly on new skills, being able to juggle many things at a time, effective communication and teamwork, and countless other skills. All things that make you a well rounded person both professionally and personally. Some of my favorite memories come from the summer internship or hanging out with my FRP coworkers in building 26 (before they tore it down). I think it’s a great idea for anyone who is interested in technology and business. If you’d like to apply to the program, please do so on the Microsoft career website.

    "title": "Thoughts on Power",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A few years ago I was at dinner with a few friends. Out of the blue one of them asked me “what is the meaning of life?”. Without thinking I blurted out “love”. Thinking that in the end, everything comes down to love. It sounded cheesy and cliche coming out of my mouth. Over the years though, I continued to ponder the question and now think more than ever that it’s the right answer.\nWhat most people want in life can mostly be boiled down to the pursuit and gaining of power. Some types of power are good for you, but the most common ones always leave you unfulfilled. You know what does fulfil you though? Love. It fills you up better than power ever could. Let’s review how most things we chase in life are just hidden forms of power.\n\nTypes of Unfulfilling Power\nStarting with unfulfilling power. These are things that can be attained in ok ways, but doing them just for the pursuit of having it is a good way to waste your life.\n\nMoney: The most popular form of power and game we play in society. Granted you want to get to a certain level of money to have a good life, but after that the more money you have the less fulfilled it makes you. Mo money, mo problems.\nStatus: This is power over how people in society look at you. There are many ways to get status. Going to an elite college or working at a prestigious job are ways to gain status. You also gain status around how you spend your money. Living in a fancy house in a fancy neighborhood punches a ticket to a different level of status than someone living in a trailer park. It’s easy for people to see what you own, and most people own certain things to convey status. Does a Rolex tell more accurate time than your phone? No but it shows that you are the type of person who can spend $10,000 minimum on an accessory you don’t really need. Increases in status normally feed your ego, which is not good for anyone.\nBeauty: Having power over other’s attention and sexual desires. This is a weird one because it can either be gained naturally (just being born) or through external means (botox, plastic surgery). If you hit the genetic lottery, congrats, but the external route is a slippery slope that usually doesn’t end well.\nFame: Having power over people’s attention. Will Smith says the process of becoming famous is fun, but maintaining fame is just ok, and losing fame is hell. You don’t know how important having a private life is until you become a famous person. Can Will Smith casually go to a local park with his family on a Sunday? Nope. His life is forever inconvenienced by his fame. How much would he pay to have a quiet afternoon on a park bench with no interruptions? It might be more than you think.\nLegacy: Having power after you’re dead. How many people donate tens of millions to a university anonymously? Almost none. Most donate and in return get their name on a building. Maybe they’re stewards of higher education but maybe they just want their name to be remembered after they’re dead. Who cares if people remember your name 100 years from now, you will be dead. I repeat, you will be dead. Has your grandpa ever talked to you about his grandpa while growing up? Probably not. People are forgotten and that’s ok.\nLeadership Roles: Having power over people’s careers. Most people think the further they progress in their careers, the more likely they will end up managing a large team or company. While that’s true for a lot of jobs, it may not be everything you expected. Maybe instead of the management promotion you actually just wanted to work on higher impact projects and have more autonomy over how you get your work done. Think about a band like the Rolling Stones. They are very good at their job, but it’s not like after their second album their record label said “you have been doing such a good job that we think you should be promoted and start overlooking other bands”. That would be crazy. Instead they were given every opportunity to write more songs and perform to bigger audiences. I think knowledge work will move more towards that in the future. Corporate rock-stars will forgo the management path and truly become the best in the world at something. With scalable technology the best person in the world at a task can literally do it for everyone else in the world.\n\n\n\nTypes of Fulfilling Power\nI’m not saying that we should all shave our head, sell our possessions, and live as a monk. It’s ok to do things in life that increase your power, but I recommend trying to increase types of power that can actually fulfill you instead of leaving you wanting more. There are types of power that compound as you continue to increase them. These are true super powers that should be prioritized in life. Here are the types of power worth pursuing.\n\nFreedom: Having power over how you spend your time. Why does America rock? People will say the freedom they have, which is another way to say they can truly do whatever they want. Having control over your time is the best power you can have.\nHealth: Having power over your own body. You might have a million thoughts and worries bounce around your head in a typical day, but when you’re sick or injured you only think about one thing. Improve your sleep, diet, and exercise and see if your life doesn’t improve by an order of magnitude.\nLearning: How does that old saying go again? Oh yeah, knowledge is power. Some would argue it’s potential power, waiting to be applied. Noticed I listed this as learning and not knowledge. Having knowledge is great but there is never a reason to stop acquiring knowledge throughout life. This power compounds as you learn more. Lean into the eighth wonder of the world and keep learning.\nReputation: Having power over other’s perceptions of your character. Warren Buffet can do billion dollar deals over the phone, no contract needed, because of his stellar reputation he built over a lifetime. A good reputation can increase your luck surface area in life. A good reputation takes time to build, but can be gone in an instant.\n\nRelationships: Having power over other people’s time. Loving friends, an amazing spouse, and children running around your house are some of the most rewarding things in life. Not having strong relationships is literally the equivalent to smoking when it comes to lifespan. I would choose these relationships wisely though. Once when I was in college my business class went to visit a local bank in Kansas City. The bank’s founder, a hunched over man in his 80s, came out to speak to us students. When asked for advice for living a good life, his response was simple. He said, “be around good people”. The older I get the more this advice makes more sense. You truly are the average of the five people you hang out with most. Choose wisely.\n\n\n\nLove Over Power\nLove what you do, love who you spend your time with, and most importantly love yourself. The most important things in life boil down to love. Truly a first principle when it comes to living a good life. Call me a hippie but it’s the truth. Stay away from the most popular desires in life that ultimately are unfulfilling power, double down on power that does fulfill you, and most importantly optimize for more love in your life."

    "title": "Time Series First Principles: Domain Expertise",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Time Series First Principles Series\nThis post dives into the first principle of a good time series forecast, domain expertise. Check out the initial post to get a high level view of each principle.\n\nDomain Expertise\nGarbage In Garbage Out\nThe Future Is Similar To The Past\nHigher Grain Higher Accuracy\nOrder Is Important\nThe Magic Is In The Feature Engineering\nSimple Models Are Better Models\nCapture Uncertainty\nModel Averages Are King\nDeep Learning Last\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nAny data scientist worth their salt can create a time series forecast for you. They can pull some data, train some machine learning (ML) models, and give you a forecast. All with you out of the loop. If that’s the case at your company, run! This is a big red flag. While that can sometimes yield good results, often the most important ingredient is missing, which is strong domain expertise about what you’re trying to forecast. This is where strong understanding of the business and market forces come into play. You know, the stuff that finance people excel at. Pairing robust ML models with strong domain expertise about the area being forecasted always yields the most accurate forecast. It also increases trust in that forecast, since the humans using that forecast know the model took into account important factors that influence the business. In this post we’ll use a hypothetical example of a company’s real estate spending to showcase the importance of domain expertise.\n\n\nTranslating Domain Expertise Into Features\nHow does domain expertise change how a ML model is created? This can manifest in many forms. The most common is changing the kind of data used in training a model. Variables that a model learns from are called “features”. Let’s apply this to our real estate spend forecast example. In the last few years, COVID and the work from home revolution have changed how people come into work. This changes how many people drink coffee, use the copier, and even which buildings stay in operation for a company. Simply pulling historical building expense data and training a model could get you ok results, but to get to peak performance you need domain expertise around what actually moves the needle for building expenses. Example features could be the square footage of a building, how many people actually badge into that building each month, even the periods where COVID was at its worse and a work from home mandate was in effect. All of these things are custom knowledge, most likely kept inside the heads of the finance workers who oversee the real estate space within a finance org.\n\n\nIteration is Key\nThrowing all of your ideas as features into a model from the start is usually not a good idea. Instead having multiple rounds of iteration is key. In the real estate example, it’s best to start out with no external features. Just use historical spend to forecast future spend. Starting with this simpler approach can sometimes get you 90% of the accuracy you need, maybe even 100% if there are stable trends and seasonality that carries into the future. Run this first to see what the initial accuracy is, and if it doesn’t meet your requirements that when we can refine by adding new data.\nOnce you have the baseline, you can look deeper into the accuracy results to see where the forecast is performing poorly. This is where domain knowledge kicks in. Poor initial forecast performance can be fixed by asking the domain expert if there is a difference between what the model knows and what a human knows. If there is a gap, can that be quantified as data to teach a model? This kind of insight can be added into a model with easy to find numeric data, or even as binary yes or no values (1 or 0) to denote when a specific one off event happened. This iterative process is where the magic happens.\nFor the real estate forecast, maybe there was a period where expenses jumped sharply in one month and stayed at that new level for the rest of the year. This will be hard for a ML model to understand or even anticipate, but the domain expert of the real estate space knows that in that specific month there were two new building openings. So the expenses of course jumped up a significant degree and stayed like that going forward. Knowing this, we can get historical square footage information and add it into our model. We can even incorporate future buildings that might be removed or added going forward. This will help a model understand how changes in total buildings impact spend.\nSo we added total square footage to our model and the results improved compared to our initial baseline of no external features. But it didn’t move the needle that much. Even though our company might be adding more buildings, in recent years the spend may not have a perfect correlation with added square footage. Knowing this, the domain expert recommends using anonymous badge in data to see who is actually coming into work. Pre-covid this data may not have been useful, since most buildings were always at max capacity with everyone coming to work each day. Now in a post-covid world this has changed forever. Some teams might only be in their assigned building 2-3 days a week. Or maybe they never returned in person, deciding instead to buy ranches in Wyoming with fast WiFi. Combining the square footage and badge in data into the model yielded fantastic results, much better than the initial baseline.\nAfter reviewing the improved results with the domain expert, the future forecast still seems a little low compared to the domain experts expectations. The domain expert has one last idea, trying to teach the model how COVID impacted spending. This can be quantified as a binary variable, where in all rows of the data we add a 1 if COVID was impacting the world, and 0 when it wasn’t. This means from early 2020 - early 2022 we have values of 1 and every period before and after we give a value of 0. A model can now understand that what happened over those two years was mostly a one off situation that is not expected going forward. After the ML model is trained with this new insight the back testing now looks great and the future forecast matches the expectations of the domain expert.\n\n\nReversal\nGetting high quality data to use as features in a model is always a good idea. There are times though where the amount of historical feature data might be lacking. For example, we may not be able to get more than 3 years of historical square footage data for our real estate expense forecast, even though we can get 5 years of historical spend data. What should we do? We can shorten the historical spend data to the last 3 years to match the square footage data, but having less data can sometimes degrade model performance. So in some cases choosing to use the full 5 years of historical spend without the square footage data is the best approach that yields the best accuracy.\nWhen facing this dilemma, try both approaches and see how accuracy is effected. I’ve seen many times that using more historical data of what you’re trying to forecast is often more accurate than shortening that data to combine it with external features.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nStarting any ML process without a business domain expert in the room is always a bad mistake. They are the cheat code in the video game that gets you to level 20 in half the time. Involving them early and often while also adopting a quick iteration approach can create a world class forecast that is trusted by the ultimate end users, which often are the domain experts themselves. At the end of the day most ML forecasts come down to trust by the end user. That’s why domain expertise is the first principle in building quality time series forecasts."

Check out the initial post in this series to get a high level view of each principle.\n\nDomain Expertise\nGarbage In Garbage Out\nThe Future Is Similar To The Past\nHigher Grain Higher Accuracy\nOrder Is Important\nThe Magic Is In The Feature Engineering\nSimple Models Are Better Models\nCapture Uncertainty\nModel Averages Are King\nDeep Learning Last\n\n\n\nYou’re Not a Wizard, Harry\nA common I see people in finance make when trying to use machine learning (ML) is around approaching it like a magic wand. Thinking as long as they bring in some data and throw it over the fence to a ML process, a perfect forecast will come back to them. All shiny and clean. ML should be able to find all of the patterns in the data and do things we humans can’t fathom right? No, wrong. ML is not a cure all thing. Having a good ML forecast starts with having quality historical data for a model to learn from. Without good data, you won’t get a good forecast. It’s as simple as that. Let’s dive into ways data can be stinky and how we can sanitize it before training models. To help illustrate each point we’ll use an example of a monthly sales forecast.\n\n\nAmount of Historical Data\nIdeally you want to get as much historical data as possible. If we want to forecast the next quarter of sales, it’s a bad idea to only use the last 12 months of historical data to train a model. Usually I try to get 5+ years of historical data before training any model. This allows for enough year over year observations for a model to learn from. For monthly forecasts, I won’t even start a forecast project if there is less than 3 years of historical data.\nHaving sufficient historical data creates the opportunity to have sufficient model back testing. Where we can see how models performed over the last few months of the data. We can then use that back testing accuracy as a proxy for what to expect for the future forecast. The less historical data you have, the less you can back test.\nThe more data you have, the longer you can forecast into the future. If I only have 3 years of historical data, it’s a bad idea to try and forecast the next 2 years. A good heuristic is to cap your forecast horizon (periods you want to forecast out) to less than 50% of the historical data. So if you want to forecast out the next 3 years of monthly sales, you need at least 6 years of historical data. When in doubt always get more data.\nWhat if I have tons of historical monthly sales data, but a cool new feature I want to use around sales pipeline is only available for the last 2 years? Most of the time, stick with using more historical data even if it’s at the expense of using highly correlated features but less historical data. Feel free to try both approaches, but often the one with the most historical data wins.\n\n\nTrend and Seasonality\nMost time series can be broken into three pieces. First is trend, is your data going up or down over time. Second is seasonality, are there peaks and valleys in your data that happen at the same time each year. Finally is the “error” or “residual” component, which is anything left over after accounting for trend and seasonality. Think of it as noise in your data. This approach of breaking down a time series into separate pieces is called time series decomposition.\nHaving recurring trends and seasonality in your historical data make things 100% easier to forecast in the future. If your data has trends that change month to month and seasonal patterns that evolve over time, your data is basically all noise. A noisy dataset is a bad dataset, one that can’t be modelled effectively by any ML model. Take a look at the below time series, each broken out by trend, seasonality, and residual. Now tell me which one would be easier to train a model on? Which would produce a high quality future forecast?\n\nYou can deal with noisy data like this in a few ways. The first is to just change the grain of the data. For example, if this was forecasting a specific product SKU, maybe instead sum it up to a higher level like product category. That way more stable trends and seasonality might appear. You can also try to add features (variables to your training data) to try to teach a model why the seasonality and trends in the data are messy. For example the main COVID years from 2020-2022 really throw a wrench in any trends or seasonal patterns in most data sets. So adding information to a data set that tells a model that there was a special one-off situation for specific periods can help a model learn the right kinds of relationships in the data and generalize well to new unseen data going forward.\n\n\nMissing Data\nMissing data is the silent killer in forecasting. If you don’t specifically look for it you might never know it’s the reason your forecasts perform poorly. Missing data is important because many models (either statistical models or ML models) often need all sequential date observations of the historical data to train a model. Even one period of missing data can throw off an entire model and lead to poor performance.\nOften times financial systems will not have tons of missing data. It’s important to know if the data that is missing should mean treated as actually missing or seen as a true zero value. For example, if we have product sales missing for a specific month, should we classify that value as truly missing or just hardcode that value to zero? Make sure you clarify that with whoever owns the data.\nIf the missing should be zero then that’s a quick fix, but if it’s truly missing then you now have another problem on your hands around what to do. Simply replacing the missing value with zero can throw off any trend or seasonality patters like we discussed earlier. Common ML advice is to replace missing feature data with the median or mean value of that feature, but this is terrible advice for time series forecasting. Usually the best approach is to use some sort of simple statistical model that can understand the trends and patterns of data around the missing value and impute what the value should be. This will keep existing trends and seasonality patterns in the data, meaning your future forecast will be more robust.\n\n\nOutliers\nAn outlier in time series forecasting is an atypical data point that significantly deviates from the overall pattern of the data. They can occur multiple times in a historical time series or just be a one off for a particular period. Either way, their presence can greatly impact how a model learns from the data.\nOutlier detection in time series forecasting often involves statistical methods, anomaly detection algorithms, or visual inspection to identify data points that significantly deviate from the typical patterns of the series. Techniques include setting thresholds based on standard deviations, using moving averages to smooth the series and highlight anomalies, applying machine learning models like isolation forests, or utilizing robust decomposition methods (like STL) to separate the series into components and identify outliers in the residuals.\nTake a look at the chart below. See how just one large value towards the end of the time series completely changes the trend and seasonality. A model might take this data and produce a huge forecast going forward, since the trend changed drastically based on the outlier. It might also have a huge spike for that specific period next year, since it learned that seasonality recently changed.\n\nThere are a few ways we can handle the presence of outliers. First we can leave it alone, and let it’s presence impact our future forecast. Maybe after talking with the business domain expert they say that there is a foundational change in the business (new product launch, tax change) that means we expect to see similar values in the future. Second we can add some more information to our data to explain what happened in that period and if we expect it to happen again in the future. If the outlier was caused by a new product launch, we can label that as a feature in the data and also tell the model if we expect any product launches in the future. A model will then learn of these one off patterns and adjust the forecast as needed. The final method is to remove the outlier altogether. Once removed, we can treat it like a missing value and replace it with a value more in line with recent trends and seasonality. If it’s truly a one off thing that will never happen again then removing it is sometimes the best approach. The choice you make always depends on the context of what caused the outlier and how we expect similar things to happen going forward.\n\n\nReversal\nSometimes having more historical data is a bad thing, and can hurt model performance. For example having 30 years of historical data could produce a good forecast, but do the trends and patterns of the business 20 years ago still apply to the business today? Often in fast changing industries this is not the case, so sometimes deliberately shortening your data is the right idea. Five years from now we may want to exclude data from pre-2023 to remove all impacts of COVID. How your customers purchased your services in 2019 is most likely very different than how they will buy them in 2024. Gee, thanks COVID.\n\n\nAutomatic Data Cleaning with finnts\nThankfully there is a solution to most of these problems. My package, finnts, helps solve a lot of the data sanitizing needed to produce a high quality forecast. It can handle outliers and missing values automatically for you. It abstracts away all of these hard topics and makes it easy to get up and running with a forecast in one line of code. Check it out.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMessy data will always lead to a messy forecast. ML models can’t save you from bad data. There’s no magic wand to cure common data problems. What you can do though is make sure your data has solid historical trends/seasonality, no missing data, and good approach to handling outliers. With these taken care of, you’re own your way to building a high quality forecast."
