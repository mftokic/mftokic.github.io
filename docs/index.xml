  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I love reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, you name it. Anything learning related is my jam. But I realized that if I don’t take notes on what I’m learning, I will probably forget everything. Now when I hear something interesting, I write it down in an Apple note for that month. Below are some of the learnings I jotted down in March, summarized by ChatGPT with additional context added by their new deep research feature. I hope you find them as interesting as I did.</p>
<section id="health-longevity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="health-longevity">Health &amp; Longevity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Alzheimer’s as “Type 3 Diabetes”</strong><br>
Some researchers now refer to Alzheimer’s disease as “type 3 diabetes” because it’s strongly linked to insulin resistance in the brain.<sup>1</sup> In essence, neurons become less responsive to insulin, which impairs memory and cognition—underscoring the huge role that blood sugar control plays in brain health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fasting—It Depends on Your A1C</strong><br>
Fasting isn’t one-size-fits-all. If your hemoglobin A1C (a marker of blood sugar) is already low (around 4.8–5.2%), aggressive fasting might stress your hormones (e.g., spiking cortisol and upsetting thyroid or sex hormones).<sup>2</sup>. But if your A1C is high, intermittent fasting can help—research shows it can reverse insulin resistance and even lower A1C levels.<sup>3</sup> The takeaway: people with high blood sugar may benefit from fasting, while those with normal/low A1C should be cautious not to overdo it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent Sleep &gt; Long Sleep</strong><br>
When it comes to sleep, consistency is king. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day has a bigger impact on health than the total hours of sleep.<sup>4</sup> In fact, maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule can add years to your life by aligning with your circadian rhythm.<sup>5</sup> It’s better to get, say, 6.5 hours every night reliably than 8 hours one night and 5 the next.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitochondria: The Root of Many Diseases</strong><br>
Many diseases boil down to broken mitochondria. These tiny energy producers, if they fail in a given tissue, cause that organ to struggle. Some experts say “mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the etiology of most common complex diseases, as well as aging”.<sup>6</sup> So protect your mitochondria through good nutrition, exercise, and reduced toxin exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autoimmune Diseases Hit Women Hardest</strong><br>
~80% of autoimmune disease patients are female.<sup>7</sup> This striking ratio could stem from hormones, genetic factors (many immune-related genes on the X chromosome), and even microbiome differences. Either way, it’s a reminder that women face unique health vulnerabilities and need specialized research and care.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Longevity “Power Rankings”</strong><br>
The most impactful factors for living longer (often into your 90s):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Don’t smoke:</strong> Smoking knocks ~10 years off your life.<sup>8</sup></li>
<li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> At least 30 minutes of moderate activity daily. This can add years to your lifespan.<sup>9</sup></li>
<li><strong>Mediterranean diet:</strong> Linked to ~20–25% lower all-cause mortality.<sup>10</sup></li>
<li><strong>BMI of ~18–22:</strong> Excess fat is risky. The average American man has 28% body fat.<sup>11</sup></li>
<li><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> Heavy drinking raises risk of cancers and liver disease.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize sleep:</strong> ~7–8 hours a night is linked to better longevity.<sup>12</sup></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Navy Dolphins Live 3x Longer</strong><br>
Dolphins in the wild typically live ~20 years, but those raised by the U.S. Navy reach 40–60 years.<sup>13</sup> It’s a striking example of how consistent nutrition, healthcare, and a protected environment can dramatically extend longevity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Humans Are Fatter Than Pigs</strong><br>
The average American man’s body fat is ~28%<sup>14</sup>, while modern farm pigs are ~16–20%. This reveals just how normalized overweight conditions have become in humans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Half-Life of Medical Knowledge</strong><br>
The “half-life” of med school training is ~18–24 months.<sup>15</sup> That means half of what doctors learn becomes outdated within two years. Rapid research advances demand ongoing education.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="human-psychology-behavior" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="human-psychology-behavior">Human Psychology &amp; Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>“Language Sets Your Limits”</strong><br>
Echoing Ludwig Wittgenstein: if you lack words for certain ideas or emotions, you struggle to conceptualize them.<sup>16</sup> Expanding your vocabulary or learning new languages can literally expand the boundaries of your world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pretty Privilege &amp; Athlete Privilege</strong><br>
Society tends to give attractive women and elite male athletes a pass on bad behavior. Studies show attractive people receive more lenient treatment<sup>17</sup>, and star athletes often face fewer consequences.<sup>18</sup> Recognizing this bias can be the first step to correcting it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mormon Influencers &amp; Journaling Culture</strong><br>
The Church of Latter-day Saints encourages regular journaling and sharing of personal insights.<sup>19</sup> This cultural norm produces individuals who are comfortable with transparent storytelling—perfectly suited to be bloggers/vloggers, which may explain their disproportionate presence online.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two Sides of a Pancake</strong><br>
An old saying: “No matter how thin a pancake, it has two sides.” It’s a simple but powerful reminder to consider multiple perspectives in conflicts or debates.<sup>20</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Habit Missed Twice Is a New Habit</strong><br>
Skip a good habit once, no big deal. Skip it twice, and you’re on your way to a new (bad) habit.<sup>21</sup> Consistency is the key—if you slip, correct course immediately.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="business-marketing-insights" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="business-marketing-insights">Business &amp; Marketing Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Product vs.&nbsp;Marketing</strong><br>
Getting the product right is crucial, but achieving <em>escape velocity</em> for your business often hinges on marketing—specifically the stories you tell. A merely “okay” product with great storytelling can outsell a brilliant product with no marketing. The best scenario is both: a product people love and a compelling narrative.<sup>22</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grey Goose: A Branding Masterclass</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>France over Russia:</strong> Leveraged French luxury connotations.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Top-Shelf Pricing:</strong> 30% higher than the competition, creating a perception of high quality.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Tall Bottle Design:</strong> Forced bars to place it on the top shelf, cementing its premium status.<sup>23</sup><br>
A reminder that marketing—especially price, packaging, and provenance—can transform a commodity (vodka) into a billion-dollar brand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Speak to an Audience of One</strong><br>
Narrow your focus to a single, ideal audience member, and your content becomes more personal, resonant, and effective. Ironically, by writing to “everyone,” you often connect with no one.<sup>24</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Growth for Growth’s Sake = Cancer</strong><br>
Mindlessly chasing growth (in business or life) can be destructive. As Edward Abbey said, “growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell”.<sup>25</sup> Pursue meaningful growth with a purpose, not expansion at all costs.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="productivity-success" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="productivity-success">Productivity &amp; Success</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learn to Say “No”</strong><br>
Successful people say no to almost everything, focusing on the select few activities that truly matter.<sup>26</sup> Time and energy are finite resources—guard them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Take Simple Ideas Seriously</strong><br>
Complexity doesn’t guarantee success. Sometimes a simple idea, executed with extraordinary focus, can outshine more elaborate plans. Think of Amazon starting with just online book sales.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Hard Path Brings Happiness</strong><br>
The path of least resistance rarely leads to fulfillment. Progress—often uncomfortable—makes you happy.<sup>27</sup> Growth happens when you embrace challenges, not avoid them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grow or Die, Then Give</strong><br>
Feeling stuck? Commit to continuous growth—new skills, knowledge, or goals—so you have more to offer others. Giving back then fuels your sense of purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Success Without Fulfillment = Failure</strong><br>
What’s the point of external “success” if you feel empty inside? True success should include joy and meaning.<sup>28</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timing Is Everything</strong><br>
Doing the right thing at the wrong time often yields zero results. Whether in business or life, <em>when</em> you act can matter as much as <em>what</em> you do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Everything Is Networks</strong><br>
Your career, friendships, and opportunities revolve around the networks you enter and exit—schools, companies, regions, or social circles.<sup>29</sup> Being in the right network at the right time can change everything. Pick your networks wisely, and reciprocate value within them.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Alzheimer’s is type 3 diabetes or insulin resistance in the brain.</li>
<li>People with low A1C levels 4.8-5.2 should most likely not do fasting since it can mess up hormones. People who have high A1C should probably fast to help improve metabolic function.</li>

<li>Fleece contains microplastics, avoid them, especially after washing them which makes it worse.</li>
<li>You need to eat 25,000 calories a day in order to get all AMA daily requirements of nutrients. That’s how much a Rhino eats.</li>
<li>Successful people say no to most things, the most successful people say no to everything. Focus and a single priority is key.</li>
<li>Most GMO crops have been modified to resist certain pesticides that kill bugs but not the plant. Protects against glyphosates, which then get into our bodies and cause all kinds of damage.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-a-univariate-model">What’s a Univariate Model?</h3>
<p>The simplest, yet often most powerful, models in time series forecasting are the oldest. These models are univariate approaches that are more statistics than new age machine learning. Univariate means that they only rely on previous values of the target variable to predict future values of that target variable. Just a timestamp and a target variable is all you need to get off the ground with univariate models.</p>
<p>This might sound too simple, but often it’s <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-05-03-time-series-simple-models/">the simplest models that can create the best forecasts</a>.</p>

<p><em>The example monthly data used in this series <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-10-02-ts-fundamentals-whats-a-time-series/example_ts_data.csv">can be found here.</a> You can also find the <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-stationary.ipynb">python code used in this post here.</a></em></p>
<section id="trends-are-hard" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trends-are-hard">Trends Are Hard</h3>
<p>In the world of forecasting, many models need the trend component to be removed in order to learn the right signal from the data. The process of removing a trend (and sometimes seasonality) is called differencing, which can make a time series become stationary.</p>
<p>Stationary just means that the time series has a constant mean and variance over time. Put simpler, it’s a time series that looks kind of random with no discernable trend or repeating seasonality. If a time series does have a trend, then we can remove it through a process called differencing, which involves subtracting a value in one time period from a value in a previous time period. More on this later.</p>
<p>Some models need data to be stationary to ensure it’s learning the correct relationships in the data, and doesn’t get fooled from thinking trends will always remain the same.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at one of our time series. Does it look like it has a constant mean and variance over time?</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Hmmm, not really. Seems like there is an upward trend to the data. This means that the mean over time will also rise. It probably also has a slightly growing variance. Meaning the year over year growth amount is getting bigger and bigger. Let’s see what we can do to make this data stationary through differencing.</p>
</section>
<section id="types-of-differencing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-differencing">Types of Differencing</h3>
<p>There are two main types of differencing. The first is simply taking the difference between two consecutive periods. For example taking the sales in December and subtracting the sales in November (previous month). This is called first order differencing. Let’s try that on our time series and see what happens.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Ok it’s looking a lot better! Our data is centered around zero, and doesn’t seem to be growing in magnitude over time. Seems like it could be stationary! Another way to apply differencing is by doing it twice, this is called second order differencing. You start by doing a first order difference, then do that same process again on that data. So instead of ending up with the change from period to period. You have the change of the change from period to period.</p>
<ul>
<li>A first order difference measures the change in position over time, which is like velocity</li>
<li>A second order difference measures the rate of change of the rate of change, which is like acceleration (the change in velocity over time)</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a second order difference is done when the time series still doesn’t have constant mean or variance. Let’s take a second order difference of our example time series.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Things changed a little, but not much. Seems like a second order difference may not always be necessary. The final way to difference your time series is through seasonal differencing. This is the difference between an observation and the previous observation from the same season. For example with monthly sales, a season difference would be taking the difference between a month this year and the same month in the previous year. Taking a seasonal difference removes most seasonality in the data, hence the name. Let’s see how our data looks by just taking a seasonal difference.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The seasonal difference result looks good. Constant mean and variance throughout time. You can also combine both standard differencing with seasonal differencing. If your data has some seasonality, it’s best to do the seasonal difference first, then take the first order difference after. Let’s see how it looks.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart5.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We now have a nice mean around zero and no major variance throughout the data. Nice! But how the heck do we know if the data is stationary once we difference it?</p>
</section>
<section id="checking-if-your-data-is-stationary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="checking-if-your-data-is-stationary">Checking if Your Data is Stationary</h3>
<p>In order to check if the data is stationary, either the original data or data that’s been differenced, you can use something called a unit root test. Specially a Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. This kind of test runs a few statistical processes and lets you know if the data it was fed was stationary or not. We can take this once step further by leveraging tools that build on this test and tell you how many differences should be applied on your data.</p>
<p>Let’s try running this test on our data and see how many differences we might need to make the data stationary.</p>
<ul>
<li>First order difference: stationary ✅</li>
<li>Second order difference: stationary ✅</li>
<li>Seasonal difference: stationary ✅</li>
<li>Seasonal and first order difference : stationary ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweet! All of our differencing techniques each resulted in our data being stationary. It’s a good idea to pick the method that is the simplest way to get a stationary time series, which in our case is the first order difference. So we can use that going forward when training models.</p>
</section>
<section id="back-transformations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-transformations">Back Transformations</h3>
<p>After you train a model and produce a forecast, the work is still not done. That forecast is the predicting the change between periods, not the actual values for that period. In order to get a final forecast we can use we need to transform that data back to the original units.</p>
<p>To do this we need all original values of the time series. When we difference our data, the process creates missing values at the start of the time series, because we cannot calculate the difference of the first period of the data since it’s the first period of the data. So a first order difference has one missing value at the start of the time series, a second order difference has 2, and a seasonal difference has many more depending on the seasonal periods in the data.</p>
<p>To get our final forecast we need to keep these original values, add them back to the differenced data, then start to add them up one by one. For a first order difference, that just means taking that original value in the first period, adding it to the differenced value in the second period, then adding that new value to the differenced value in the third period, and so on. It’s a daisy chained process to get the original data back. We carry this math forward into the future with our predictions, with the final output being our finished forecast!</p>
<p>Here’s a super simple table breaking this down.</p>

<p>There are cases where differencing your data to ensure it’s stationary is not a good idea. Some models, like arima, have the differencing process built in. So you don’t need to do it beforehand. Other models, like standard linear regressions, don’t need stationary data at all since they can easily learn from trends and seasonal patterns in the data.</p>
<p>Differencing the data can also limit model interpretability, or the ability to explain the forecasted outputs. This becomes even harder once you start to difference your data two or more times, since you are not explaining changes between observations, but instead the change in the changes or even worse. This becomes near impossible to understand for any regular human that might use your forecasts.</p>
<p>A final thing to call out with differencing is that it can remove historical data from the beginning of your time series. This may not be a big deal with a first order difference, but taking a seasonal difference on a monthly data set will remove the first 12 months of the time series. That may not be impactful if you have 10+ years of historical data, but if you only have 3 years to start with this becomes very detrimental to the process. That’s why I try to limit any seasonal differencing when the amount of historical data is low.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Stationarity is fundamental to reliable forecasting because it ensures your models are learning stable, meaningful patterns rather than temporary or misleading trends. A stationary time series maintains a constant mean and variance over time, making its behavior predictable and easier for statistical models to learn from.</p>
<p>Differencing is a powerful yet straightforward way to achieve stationarity, paving the path for more accurate forecasts. While simple first-order differencing often does the trick, be cautious with higher-order or seasonal differences, as they can reduce interpretability, remove valuable historical context, and complicate back transformations. Always prioritize the simplest approach that achieves stationarity, keeping both modeling and explanations clear and intuitive. Ultimately, knowing how—and when—to apply stationarity transformations is key to building robust, effective forecasts.</p>

  <title>Your Genes Are Making You Sick</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="what-gets-measured-gets-managed" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-gets-measured-gets-managed">What Gets Measured, Gets Managed</h3>
<p>Our bodies are mostly a mystery to a regular person. Everyone takes vitamins, but do they actually help your body operate better? If you don’t know what kind of vitamins your body needs, there’s a good chance supplements you take every day are actively hurting your body or are simply being pissed down the drain (literally). Nobody wants to take something that is a waste of time. So how do you know what nutrients your body needs? This is where understanding methylation in your body comes in.</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-methylation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-methylation">What’s Methylation?</h3>
<p>Methylation is the process of converting nutrients you eat into things your body can actually use. We eat crude oil in the form of food, and our body uses methylation to process it into gasoline in to use for various processes that help us thrive. The issue is that our body rarely does this all perfectly. Many of us have gene mutations that inhibit this kind of conversation process. Let’s walk through some of the most common gene mutations around methylation and see how we can make sure our bodies are operating at their maximal potential.</p>
</section>
<section id="mthfr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mthfr">MTHFR</h3>
<p>Commonly known as the “mother fucker” gene, this one can be a real mother fucker. Up to 44% of people in the world carry this gene mutation. MTHFR deals with how our body handles the nutrient called folate. It translates the folate we get from our food into a form our bodies can use called methylfolate or 5-MTHF, which is the methylated version of folate.</p>
<p>5-MTHF helps break down a compound in our body called homocysteine. Which is one of the most inflammatory compound in the human body. Inflammation is very bad for our body folks. When this compound is high all crazy types of things happen. Here are just a couple of things that are impacted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating neurotransmitters</li>
<li>DNA repair</li>
<li>Detoxing</li>
<li>Regulating blood pressure</li>
<li>Miscarriages during pregnancy</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
</ul>
<p>Folate can be found in leafy greens and legumes. But the most common way we consume folate is through a compound called folic acid. Folic acid is the most common additive to our food. It’s literally everywhere. White rice and can flour contain folic acid. When ingredients say “fortified” or “enriched”, that means folic acid was added. This is bad news for people with the MTHFR mutation because they cannot process folic acid into the form our body needs. I will repeat, folic acid is the most common additive in food but cannot be properly processed by almost half of the worlds population. It’s even found in some prenatal vitamins, which has been linked to miscarriages and postpartum depression. Not good!</p>
<p>I know this is kind of scary to read, but thankfully there is some good news. There are easy ways to work around this gene mutation and ensure you are thriving in life. Here’s what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid all forms of folic acid, which limits your processed food intake, which is a major health win overall</li>
<li>Take the methylated version of folate, <a href="https://a.co/d/4TwoR4o">called 5-MTHF</a>, at night before going to bed</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="mtr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mtr">MTR</h3>
<p>Similar to MTHFR, the MTR gene also plays in a role in regulating homocysteine by converting it into another compound called methionine. For this reaction to work, your body needs vitamin B12, specifically the methylated versions of B12 like methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin.</p>
<p>If you have this gene mutation, you may experience certain gut issues like these.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Bloating</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Constipation</li>
<li>Cramping</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplementing with B12 is crucial for this gene mutation, but similar to MTHFR not all supplements are created equal. Stay away from a form of B12 called Cyanocobalamin. This form contains hydrogen cyanide, which is a known neurotoxin. It’s often added into cheap energy drinks and even milk! Companies do this because it’s cheap and they don’t care, so care for yourself and avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do if you have this gene mutation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit alcohol, which depletes methyl donors and can interfere with B12 absorption</li>
<li>Avoid heavy metals (like mercury and lead) that bind to B12, making it unavailable for MTR to use</li>
<li>Take the methylated version of B12, either methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin found in <a href="https://a.co/d/fHQiO9z">methylated multivitamins</a>
<ul>
<li>FYI not everyone can process methylcobalamin, but 100% of humans can process hydroxocobalamin in their body</li>
<li>If you also have the COMT gene mutation, you absolutely should be taking hydroxocobalamin since your body can process that better than other forms like methylcobalamin</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="mtrr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mtrr">MTRR</h3>
<p>This gene works closely with the MTR gene, hence similar names. It helps reactivate B12 that was used by the MTR gene when converting homocysteine into methionine. Over time B12 can become oxidized when used by the MTR gene, so MTRR comes in to convert it back into its methylated form so it can be properly used again. MTRR is also important in the thyroid, helping convert one important thyroid hormone T4 into T3, which happens in your gut.</p>
<p>If you have this gene mutation, you might suffer from the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart burn</li>
<li>Acid reflux</li>
<li>Thyroid issues</li>
<li>Short temper</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Exacerbations of ADD, ADHD, OCD</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the same guidelines as described in the MTR section above. Avoid the wrong types of B12 and make sure to take versions that your body can actually use.</p>
</section>
<section id="ahcy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ahcy">AHCY</h3>
<p>This gene helps break down S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) into homocysteine and adenosine. This process is critical because SAH is a strong inhibitor of methylation enzymes. If it builds up, it slows down methylation reactions throughout the body. SAH is one of the most inflammatory compounds in your body, even worse than homocysteine.</p>
<p>This is a rare gene mutation to have, but people with it can have addictive tendencies. For example, addiction to video games as kids, then phones as teenagers, then drugs, alcohol, sugar, working out, eating, sex, shopping, working. This is caused by wide ranges in dopamine in the body, which is tied to our behaviors. So people with this mutation tend to seek out dopamine rewarding behavior.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do if you have this gene mutation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consume collagen to ensure your ingesting enough glycine to help your body balance methionine. If AHCY isn’t efficiently breaking down SAH, excess methionine intake might lead to toxic byproducts instead of proper methylation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="comt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comt">COMT</h3>
<p>This gene breaks down major neurotransmitters in the body. Things like dopamine and adrenaline. It’s also responsible for metabolizing estrogens, and having too much of this hormone for both men and women can be bad. When your body can’t break these these things, all sorts of things get out of whack.</p>
<p>If you have this gene mutation, you might suffer from the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stress and anxiety</li>
<li>Trouble winding down and sleeping</li>
<li>Quick to anger, slow to calm down</li>
<li>Higher estrogen levels, which can lead to water retention under the belly button and around the waist</li>
<li>Pain sensitivity</li>
<li>ADD or ADHD</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully it’s not all bad with this gene mutation. Because things like dopamine stay around longer in your brain, it can lead to higher creativity and deep thinking. But this comes at a cost of overanalyzing and worrying.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do if you have this gene mutation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid green tea and quercitin (found in green tea and other supplements) at all costs. These can make your COMT symptoms much worse.</li>
<li>If you have excess water retention around your belly, look into taking a <a href="https://a.co/d/8Af2hyP">diindolylmethane (DIM) supplement</a>, which can help reduce that water retention by removing excess estrogen in your body.</li>
<li>Consider taking a <a href="https://a.co/d/eZ5ui5I">trimethylglycine (TMG) supplement</a>, which can help regulate the processes that maintain your neurotransmitters</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-they-all-connect" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-they-all-connect">How They All Connect</h3>
<p>Processes in our body can be thought of like a group of construction workers passing sandbags to each other in a single line. One gene can do a process the body needs, then pass the output along to another gene to do another process, and so on. But if one of those genes can only pass along 4 sandbags instead of the 10 needed, then the most any of the downstream genes will get is 40% of what’s required.</p>
<p>This is why understanding genetic methylation in our bodies is so important. Each of these 5 genes play a crucial role in making our bodies work.</p>
<p>Let’s do a recap of each gene and what they do in our methylation process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MTHFR starts the process by making active folate (5-MTHF)</li>
<li>MTR uses 5-MTHF &amp; B12 to convert homocysteine into methionine</li>
<li>MTRR keeps MTR working by recharging B12</li>
<li>AHCY clears out byproducts and provides fresh homocysteine</li>
<li>COMT uses methylation to break down stress chemicals and estrogen</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these genes don’t work well, the whole system slows down! The fix is to support each gene with the right nutrients and to avoid things your body may not be able to handle.</p>
</section>
<section id="dna-testing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dna-testing">DNA Testing</h3>
<p>How the heck do I know if I have any gene mutations? This is where testing comes in. There are a lot of services out there that will do a genetic methylation test for you. They cost a few hundred dollars, but it’s a test you only need to run once in your life.</p>
<p>It’s a simple cheek swab you do at home then mail in. I used a service called <a href="https://10xhealthsystem.com/genetest/">10X Health</a>, but there are many providers out there who can help.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>I got my results back about a month ago, and things did not look good. I had mutations in all 5 genes except AHCY, with the MTHFR and COMT genes having the strongest mutation (meaning they don’t work). These results are kind of like getting a personality test result. You start to understand who you are as a person more. Why you act and feel a certain way. You start to understand your parents and siblings so much more, because they most likely carry similar genes as you. It’s life changing to receive information that shows you how to live a better life with 100% certainty.</p>
<p>My gene results showed that I had to really crack down on folic acid (MTHFR gene) and green tea/quercetin (COMT). I realized some of my most beloved foods and supplements, that are supposed to be healthy, actually contain things that are the worst to put into my body. Since cleaning those up I have had an easier time falling asleep, and my brain is working better than ever. It’s also been easier to avoid processed food, because I know almost all of it contains things that my body cannot handle well. So the temptation to binge on them has been removed. Thank goodness!</p>
<p>If you’d like to live up to your highest potential in life. Consider taking control of your genetics and get tested! It might just change your life.

<p>I love reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, you name it. Anything learning related is my jam. But I realized that if I don’t take notes on what I’m learning, I will probably forget everything. Now when I hear something interesting, I write it down in an Apple note for that month.

<section id="a-man-must-have-a-code" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-man-must-have-a-code">A Man Must Have a Code</h3>
<p>Every person lives by a set of principles that govern their actions throughout life. They are either principles inherited by the society they were raised in (unconsciously), or principles that were chosen and updated by a person on their own (consciously). The best principles in life are ones you have thought through yourself. Below are the top principles I like to live my life by.</p>
</section>
<section id="bias-for-action" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bias-for-action">Bias for Action</h3>
<p>Action is the best answer to most problems. Sitting around waiting for something to happen to you rarely works out. No one ever get’s lucky sitting on their couch watching Netflix. Action creates luck, creates feedback, and also creates momentum.</p>
</section>
<section id="sense-of-urgency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sense-of-urgency">Sense of Urgency</h3>
<p>Life is short, and timelines are negotiable. Ever heard of the parkinson principle? It states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Got an important work project due in a month? It will probably take you a month to do. Does the same project need to be done by Friday? Then you will also probably finish it Friday morning.</p>
<p>Reality is negotiable. Peter Thiel has a saying: “If you have a 10 year plan of how to get somewhere, you should ask: why can’t I do this in 6 months?”. The quality of your questions determines the quality of your life.</p>
<p>When you combine a sense of urgency with a bias for action, you become an unstoppable force. This brings us to my next principle.</p>
</section>
<section id="high-agency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="high-agency">High Agency</h3>
<p>Who would you call to break you out of a third world prison? That person has a high sense of agency, which means they have have the ability to control what happens to them in life. Think of it as the opposite of a victim mentality. Agency is the combination of a bias for action with a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>George Mack does a good job discussing agency. <a href="https://x.com/george__mack/status/1661426260327759902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1661426260327759902%7Ctwgr%5E7eacc97032d4e2d008f3d1d669bb67c347937b2c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.beehiiv.com%2Flogin%3F_gl%3D11bn3wdj_gaNTI1OTM1NjEuMTY4NjMyNDQzMg.._ga_E6Y4WLQ2ECMTY4NjMyNDQzMi4xLjAuMTY4NjMyNDQzMi42MC4wLjA.&amp;utm_source=clouds-and-dirt.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=lindy-library-the-0-1-of-ideas-i-ve-found">Here is a good example</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="zero-expectations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="zero-expectations">Zero Expectations</h3>
<p>When Charlie Munger was asked about what it takes to live a happy life his response was simple, have low expectations. In a similar vein, Naval Ravikant states that happiness is a simple equation. Happiness = Reality - Expectations.</p>
<p>If you came to Seattle in January and expected it to be warm and sunny, you’d be bummed out if it was 50 degrees with a slight drizzle. Instead if you came expecting it to be cold and constantly raining, then you’d be pleasantly surprised to find out that it didn’t rain much at all. The same external events happened in both examples, but the change in expectations made for a better outcome.</p>
<p>It’s ok to have high expectations for yourself, but having high expectations over things in life you can’t control is a recipe for disaster.</p>
</section>
<section id="time-over-money" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-over-money">Time Over Money</h3>
<p>Control over how you spend your time is the ultimate freedom and source of power. It’s the life razor I use to make most decisions in my life.</p>
</section>
<section id="love-over-power" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="love-over-power">Love Over Power</h3>
<p>Most things we chase in life are a <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-03-13-power-pursuits/">form of power</a>. Money, status, fame, beauty, these are all forms of power. They will not make you fulfilled in life. You know what will? Love.</p>
</section>
<section id="giving-without-getting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="giving-without-getting">Giving Without Getting</h3>
<p>Giving away my time, attention, and skills with no expectations of something in return is very important to me. Nothing grinds my gears like someone doing a good deed in the world then immediately posting about it on social media. They are giving with the intention of receiving status in return. Giving yourself to others is an amazing act in and of itself, full stop.</p>
</section>
<section id="stay-present" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stay-present">Stay Present</h3>
<p>If you think about the future, you are anxious. If you think about the past, you are depressed. Staying in the future moment is the best way to live a happy and purpose filled life.</p>
</section>
<section id="stagnation-is-death" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stagnation-is-death">Stagnation is Death</h3>
<p>If you are coasting, you are going downhill. Always be learning, always be evolving. If you are not learning, you are dying.</p>
</section>
<section id="keep-it-simple" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keep-it-simple">Keep it Simple</h3>
<p>The best solutions to problems in life are the simplest. Keep it simple stupid.</p>
</section>
<section id="incentives-matter" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incentives-matter">Incentives Matter</h3>
<p>Charlie Munger once said “show me the incentive and I’ll show you the behavior”. Incentives rule most things in life. Use the right incentive and you will change your life, and maybe the world.</p>
</section>
<section id="run-towards-fear" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-towards-fear">Run Towards Fear</h3>
<p>Usually the things you are the most afraid of are the most important things that you need to do to improve your life. Scared of public speaking? Then getting good at it will probably change your life more than anything else.</p>
</section>
<section id="allergic-to-status" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="allergic-to-status">Allergic to Status</h3>
<p>Increasing your status will not create a fulfilling life. So I try not to do things that inflate my status. Comparison is the thief of joy. Never compare yourself to others (aka your status compared to others), only compare yourself to who you were yesterday.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-things-worth-writing-write-things-worth-reading" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-things-worth-writing-write-things-worth-reading">Do Things Worth Writing, Write Things Worth Reading</h3>
<p>This is a quote from Ben Franklin. I think it’s a great life philosophy. I try to do both interesting things, and write interesting things. Heck, you are hopefully reading something interesting right now!</p>
</section>
<section id="what-would-you-do-if-you-couldnt-fail" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-would-you-do-if-you-couldnt-fail">What Would You Do If You Couldn’t Fail?</h3>
<p>This is a fantastic question to ask yourself. It can help you determine your career path and most of your major decisions in life. If you are stuck in your career, asking this question can point you in the right direction.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-makes-for-the-best-story" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-for-the-best-story">What Makes for the Best Story?</h3>
<p>Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, uses this question as the final decision framework for big life moves. When deciding between two paths, taking the one that makes for the better story will almost always create a better life for you. Choose wisely.</p>
</section>
<section id="did-i-always-do-my-best" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="did-i-always-do-my-best">Did I Always Do My Best?</h3>
<p>John Wooden says that “success is the peace of mind that is the direct result of self-satisfaction knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming”. He didn’t care about the score of the game, he only cared that his players rose to their full potential. If they did that, everything else will take care of itself. Even if they lost, they still were at peace because they knew they did their best. This is a powerful idea and one that people today seem to overlook.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-be-the-best-be-the-only" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-be-the-best-be-the-only">Don’t Be the Best, Be the Only</h3>
<p>This comes from the law of category from a book called <a href="https://a.co/d/9bse5C6">The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing</a>. It’s better to be the first person in a new industry than to be the 10th person. Finding things that you are the only person in the world doing is a good place to be.</p>
</section>
<section id="stop-trying-to-sound-smart" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stop-trying-to-sound-smart">Stop Trying to Sound Smart</h3>
<p>I’ve had to learn this one the hard way. Stop trying to be right all of the time. Stop trying to one up people with more interesting facts or stories. Stop correcting people. Once you stop, the quality of your relationships improve, which improves your entire life.</p>
</section>
<section id="hard-choices-easy-life.-easy-choices-hard-life." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hard-choices-easy-life.-easy-choices-hard-life.">Hard Choices, Easy Life. Easy Choices, Hard Life.</h3>
<p>This comes from Jerzy Gregorek. If you make the easy choice of eating junk food today, your life will become much harder in the future once you develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But if you make the hard choices of diet and exercise today, future you will be happy and healthy. This approach applies to most things in life. Hard now, easy later.</p>
</section>
<section id="gear-over-stuff" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gear-over-stuff">Gear Over Stuff</h3>
<p>This was outlined in Michael Easter’s book called <a href="https://a.co/d/2GHLZeR">Scarcity Brain</a>. Having more stuff in my life weighs me down, increasing stress. Instead gear serves a purpose in your life. You can have tons of stuff, but only so much gear.</p>
</section>
<section id="avoid-scarcity-loops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoid-scarcity-loops">Avoid Scarcity Loops</h3>
<p>This is the main concept outlined in Michael Easter’s book called <a href="https://a.co/d/2GHLZeR">Scarcity Brain</a>. It has three parts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Opportunity</li>
<li>Unpredictable Rewards</li>
<li>Quick Repeatability</li>
</ol>
<p>Scarcity loops are built to make us crave certain behaviors that are most likely not good for us. Once you learn this you see it everywhere. Let’s take checking your email. It’s easy to open the app on your phone (opportunity), you may or may not have any new unread emails (unpredictable rewards), and you can easily recheck for new emails five minutes later (quick repeatability). Checking your email constantly is obviously not good for you, but scarcity loops change your behavior for the worst. There are also scarcity loops on social media, junk food, drinking, drugs, gambling, online shopping, and literally anything else that is not healthy for you.</p>
<p>Avoid them at all cost.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-most-important-question" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-most-important-question">The Most Important Question</h3>
<p>Josh Waitzkin has a framework called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnGtVDU-Yw4&amp;t">the most important question</a> that helps train you on discovering what matters most. Knowing where to focus your energy is often more important than how hard you work at something. Remember, the quality of your questions determines the quality of your life. So being able to think about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfv2d1ItzOQ">the most important question to solve</a> for in your job, marriage, etc. is paramount.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>To live a quality life you must have quality principles. If you don’t, you will be easily influenced to live an unauthentic life based on the expectations of society. Feel free to take some of mine to use as your own principles, or don’t! I could care less, because I have zero expectations about people reading this post.</p>

<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-02-03-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning">data cleaning chapter</a> within a larger learning series around time series forecasting fundamentals. <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-09-25-ts-fundamentals/">Check out the main learning path</a> to see other posts in the series.</em></p>
<p><em>The example monthly data used in this series <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-10-02-ts-fundamentals-whats-a-time-series/example_ts_data.csv">can be found here.</a> You can also find the <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/2025-02-05-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-boxcox.ipynb">python code used in this post here.</a></em></p>
<section id="keeping-it-in-between-the-lines" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keeping-it-in-between-the-lines">Keeping It In Between The Lines</h3>
<p>Most of time series forecasting is all about trying to fit a line to your data. There are a million ways to do it, but at its core we want to fit a line that’s as close as possible to the original data and where we think future data points might lie.</p>
<p>The easiest line to fit is already a straight line, or one that has linear growth. Consider the chart below. What do you think the future forecast will be? Pretty easy, a model can just extend the same upward linear growth going forward.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-02-05-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-boxcox/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We would always prefer to model a time series that has a linear trend. But often that’s not the case in businesses. Revenue might double every year, and that my friend is not a linear line, but instead an exponential one. A time series growing exponentially is harder for many models to forecast because most models expect the variance of the data to stay the same over time (more on this in the stationary post), and a expanding time series violates this assumption. Consider one of our example time series in our dataset below. See how it grows not at a linear pace but a hockey stick like exponential pace?</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-02-05-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-boxcox/chart2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>A good way to handle this exponential growth is to transform it into one that looks more linear. This is where a technique called a box-cox transformation comes in handy.</p>
</section>
<section id="box-cox-enters-the-chat" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="box-cox-enters-the-chat">Box-Cox Enters The Chat</h3>
<p>The Box-Cox transformation is a family of power transformations that aim to make data more normally distributed and stabilize its variance​. In simple terms, it transforms your original values using an exponent (λ, “lambda”) to reduce skewness.</p>
<p>Lambda can take many values. A lambda of 0 corresponds to a log transform. A value of 0.5 is a square root transform. By transforming our data this way we can in essence de-scale the data to ensure any large spikes are dampened and easier for a model to fit the data. This can transform our data to be homoscedastic, or having constant variance. Let’s see how our time series looks after applying a few box-cox transformations.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-02-05-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-boxcox/chart3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-02-05-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-boxcox/chart4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The log transformation (lambda = 0) seems to have done a great job at turning our exponential growth into linear growth. The square root transformation (lambda = 0.5) didn’t do as well. Choosing the right value of lambda is important, thankfully there is an automated process that can do it for us. Let’s see how the data looks with an optimal lambda value chosen automatically.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-02-05-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-boxcox/chart5.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The automated process chose a lambda value very close to zero. So it basically did a simple log transformation. Now our data has become much easier to model correctly, how cool is that!</p>

<li><strong>Runaway exponential trends</strong>: If your time series has exponential trend aspects, but isn’t actually a true exponential trend, there can be big repercussions. A model might take that transformed data and start creating future forecasts that are astronomical in size, going from thousands to trillions in a few periods. A good example is a time series that is stable for most of its history, then at the very end it all of a sudden has tripled in value over one or two periods. A box-cox transformation will pick up on this and transform the data in a way that a model might pick up on as a trend that should grow into the future. So each subsequent forecast period might continue to triple in value. That’s not good.</li>
<li><strong>Time series can’t be zero or negative</strong>: All zero values must be changed to be a placeholder value like 0.1 or 1, that way things like a log transformation can work. There also can’t be any negative values, again because you can’t take the log of a negative number, which in some time series is unavoidable.</li>
<li><strong>Need to back transform the data after forecasting</strong>: After you train a model and create a forecast on the transformed data, you must transform the forecast back to the original units. So you have to make sure you keep the lambda value used in the box-cox transformation handy, because you will need it to inverse the transformation.</li>
<li><strong>Less model interpretability</strong>: Because a model is learning on transformed data, being able to explain the models decisions become harder. Know there is always a tradeoff between model accuracy and model interpretability.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Box-Cox transformations are a powerful tool for taming exponential growth in time series, making trends easier to model and forecast. However, like any transformation, they come with tradeoffs. Potentially misleading trends, the need for careful handling of zeros and negatives, and additional steps to back-transform predictions. Despite these challenges, applying box-cox correctly can make a significant difference in forecasting accuracy. The key takeaway? Use transformations thoughtfully, always validate their impact on your specific dataset, and remember that the best forecast starts with well-prepared data.</p>

<p>The result of exploratory data analysis can reveal a lot about your data. One factor it can bubble up is how clean the data is, and if there needs to be any interventions done before we start training models. Cleaning your data is an important next step. If your data is garbage, you will create a garbage forecast. <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-04-08-time-series-garbage/">Gargbage in, garbage out.</a></p>

<p>I love reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, you name it. Anything learning related is my jam. But I recently realized that if I don’t take notes on what I’m learning, I will probably forget everything. Now when I hear something interesting, I write it down in an Apple note for that month.

  <title>What Item Would You Bring to a Deserted Island?</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-01-31-knowledge/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For the first time in history, the answer to the following questions of “what item would you bring to a deserted island” and “what item would you keep to start civilization over from scratch” is now the same thing. You would bring ChatGPT, or put more generally a large language model (llm) or generative AI model. At its core, these AI models condense the knowledge of the data it was trained on. It can acquire knowledge and know how to apply it, which is the definition of intelligence. This proves that the most important thing in our world is access to knowledge and how to use it, aka intelligence, and AI models are the best container for knowledge. Let’s dive deeper into why ChatGPT is the best item to bring to a deserted island. Before everyone gets their panties in a bunch about needing internet access for ChatGPT, let’s assume it’s an offline model running locally inside an indestructible cube that is powered by a hand crank and solar panels. Ok? Good. Let’s continue.</p>
<p>When you crash on the island, the AI would tell you what you need to do first to survive. Most likely how to build a shelter with the elements you have around you. Teach you how to get fresh water. Show you which mushrooms are poisonous and which make for a tasty treat. It could entertain you with stories. Even act as a friend for companionship in a lonely place. Having a physical tool like a hatchet would be nice, but it’s not going to help administer first aid to you when you accidentally cut yourself while chopping wood.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to bring other forms of knowledge to the island. Maybe a waterproof copy of a survival manual. That would definitely help you survive the first few nights and eventually thrive on the island. But only for your most basic needs. What if you found other people on the island? Maybe a potential partner you want to settle down with and start a family? The survival book is not going to help you deliver a child.</p>
<p>Instead of a survival book you could bring an entire encyclopedia. Either one of those old school physical books, or a print out of everything on Wikipedia. That could help you with a lot of things. But now your problem is knowing where to find the right knowledge to help you with new problems. Does that rash on your arm match with the description of a rare disease in the encyclopedia? Hard to say. You then find another tribe on the island that speaks a different language as you and they seem pretty pissed off. Scrolling through Wikipedia for 30 minutes can’t help you there. So it’s not enough to have the knowledge itself at hand, but easy ways to access exactly what you need, when you need it.</p>
<p>Easy access to knowledge used to be driven by search engines like Google and Bing. They could search through various information for you automatically. In a sense they condensed the entire internet into a text box to ask questions. But what came out on the other side are things that might be able to help, but not the exact knowledge you might need immediately or how to apply it to solve your problem. New AI services like ChatGPT can do just that. It knows most of what a search engine might know, but it can find the right answer immediately. It’s also able to create new information never thought possible, because it wasn’t in the original training data. Google search may not know what to do when a completely new event like a meteorite hits your island. But ChatGPT can reason and give you the knowledge and implementation to deal with the incident. It not only knows what, it also knows how. Knowledge is power. But being able to apply knowledge correctly, aka intelligence, is even more powerful.</p>
<p>The cost of intelligence with AI is quickly going to zero. What happens then? It feels like the two most important jobs going forward in an AI future is either building smarter AI models. Or finding the right data to feed them. By building smarter models you are improving the how (intelligence), and by getting better data you are improving the what (knowledge). The scary part is that AI models can now create their own synthetic training data, and techniques like reinforcement learning allow them to essential train themselves. So manual human intervention in these models might go away too. What’s left to do if the AI can train itself and get better every day?</p>
<p>The answer is to use the AI to make humans better. To increase their knowledge of the what and the how. Imagine a 30 year old accountant who has never camped outside in their life lands on the island with ChatGPT. They would most likely be able to get by with the help of the AI, but they would still struggle initially, maybe even perish from plain bad luck. Now replace that person with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls">Bear Grylles</a>, the famous British survival expert. I mean, the dudes name is literally “Bear”, how could he not survive in the wild? Combine him with ChatGPT and now he turns into a superhuman. He already knows how to survive, and paired with ChatGPT he can now build an island empire.</p>
<p>Having a smart AI is good, but having a smart AI combined with a smart human is even better. As these AI models get smarter, they should also enable humans to get smarter as well. If you want to start learning how to code today, you shouldn’t read a textbook on python. Instead have ChatGPT start teaching you. It’s a world class tutor available 24/7, tailored to your learning style, and is infinitely patient. It can write code for you, explain how it works, and then quiz you about it. <strong>Using AI to increase the collective knowledge and intelligence of every person in the world should be a top priority.</strong></p>
<p>So many problems in our world today can partly be due to a lack of education. When using a college degree as a proxy for education, the problems in our society stick out. People who don’t have a college degree have more problems.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.idra.org/resource-center/college-degrees-are-worth-it-people-with-bachelors-degrees-have-lower-poverty-rates/">Poverty</a>: In 2019 people with a college degree earned $25,000 more than someone with only a high school diploma.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2018/10/30/education-report/">Crime</a>: Less than 4% of formerly incarcerated people have a college degree.</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28756896/">Suicide</a>: Men without a college degree are twice as likely to die from suicide compared to a college graduate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having a college degree is not a perfect measure of who has knowledge and who does not. But the above stats paint a bad picture for those without a degree. Soon everyone with an internet connection will have access to the best tutor in the world, essentially for free. AI tutors can teach billions of people at once. The only limiting factors will become tailoring the AI tutor to each persons wants and needs, and a person’s thirst for knowledge. There’s an old saying that goes: “The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.” We can tailor the AI tutors to the learner, but creating the want inside of people to learn is the hard part. In a world of video games and TikTok, getting someone excited to learn about chemistry or to simply read a book will be a challenge.</p>
<p>This is where the multimodal nature of AI models can save the day. The AI can print out text, talk to you via voice, even create photos and videos. This unlocks limitless ways for an AI to teach you something. Someone may prefer a book like experience with an AI using chat, whereas another may learn best through a superhero movie that teaches you about greek mythology. Creating an AI tutor that a person can’t turn away from is one of the most important problems to work on. Imagine your 10 year old staying up all night because they don’t want to stop learning about the migratory patterns of birds, or how nuclear fusion works, instead of watching TikTok dance trends. This is a possible future. AI is up to the task.</p>
<p>AI models are not only positioned to make the world better, they are also well positioned to make humans better. Let’s go build one.</p>

<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-10-03-ts-fundamentals-eda/">exploratory data analysis chapter</a> within a larger learning series around time series forecasting fundamentals. <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-09-25-ts-fundamentals/">Check out the main learning path</a> to see other posts in the series.</em></p>
<p><em>The example monthly data used in this series <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-10-02-ts-fundamentals-whats-a-time-series/example_ts_data.csv">can be found here.</a> You can also find the <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/2025-01-24-ts-fundamentals-eda-xregs.ipynb">python code used in this post here.</a></em></p>
<section id="may-the-outside-forces-be-with-you" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="may-the-outside-forces-be-with-you">May The Outside Forces Be With You</h3>
<p>When creating a time series forecast, you really only need three columns. One to identify one time series from another, a timestamp (date) column, and your target variable. With these three things you can produce high quality forecasts. Unfortunately most time series do not live in a vacuum, and are subject to outside forces. These forces could be things like macroeconomic factors like inflation or consumer sentiment. The growing market share of your competitors. Or even when your product might go on sale. These are all external regressors (xregs), or outside data points that can be used to improve the predictive accuracy of our time series forecast.</p>
<p>External regressors come in many shapes and sizes. They are usually chosen based on the <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-04-02-time-series-domain-expertise/">domain expertise</a> of whatever you’re trying to forecast. Outside of a hunch that they might work, how can we tell if they should be used in our time series forecast? Let’s walk through a few methods to measure the relationship between external regressors and our target variable.</p>
</section>
<section id="measuring-linear-relationships" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-linear-relationships">Measuring Linear Relationships</h3>
<p>The most straightforward approach is a simple correlation analysis. We take the external regressor time series, and calculate the correlation against our target variable time series. This gives us a value between -1 and 1. Having either a strong negative correlation or positive correlation are both helpful. Here are a few rules of thumb to measure strong correlations of external regressors based on the date grain of your data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Year/Quarter/Month: Absolute value correlation of 0.5 or higher.</li>
<li>Week/Day: Absolute value correlation of 0.2 or higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that those values are arbitrary. This isn’t a perfect threshold to use. So make sure you adjust that based on your own time series data. Let’s take a time series from our example dataset and calculate the correlation against a few external regressors.</p>

<p>The table confirms our initial smell test after reading the line chart. Xreg1 has a strong correlation, and xreg2 does not. This tells us that xreg1 could be a good candidate to use as a feature in our ML forecast model. What if we don’t know what xreg1 values are going to be in the future? That’s where calculating correlation on lags becomes valuable. We can calculate lags for 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and onward to see if lag values of our external regressors can also be used as features.</p>

<p>In addition to the original xreg1 (at lag 0), the 1 and 12 month lags also have a high correlation. A 12 month lag shows that there is strong seasonality in both our original time series and xreg1. This will be helpful once we start to train models.</p>

<section id="measuring-non-linear-relationships" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-non-linear-relationships">Measuring Non-Linear Relationships</h3>
<p>Traditional correlation is great and all, but falls short if there are non-linear relationships between the variables. In order to capture non-linear relationships, we have to bring in some heavy firepower. Using either of the below approaches.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mutual Information (MI)
<ul>
<li>Overview:
<ul>
<li>Measures the shared information between two variables (or time series).</li>
<li>Captures linear and non-linear dependencies.</li>
<li>Based on information theory: higher MI indicates more shared patterns or dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Key Points:
<ul>
<li>Values are always non-negative.</li>
<li>MI = 0: No dependence (variables are independent).</li>
<li>Higher MI: Greater dependency or shared information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation:
<ul>
<li>MI doesn’t distinguish between positive or negative relationships (unlike correlation).</li>
<li>It only reflects the strength of dependency, not its direction or type.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distance Correlation (dCor)
<ul>
<li>Overview:
<ul>
<li>Measures the dependence between two variables by analyzing distances between all pairwise points.</li>
<li>Captures both linear and non-linear relationships.</li>
<li>Unlike MI, dCor is normalized to a specific range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Key Points:
<ul>
<li>Values range from 0 to 1.</li>
<li>dCor = 0: Variables are independent.</li>
<li>dCor = 1: Perfect dependence (linear or non-linear).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation:
<ul>
<li>A value closer to 0: Weak or no dependency.</li>
<li>A value closer to 1: Strong dependency.</li>
<li>It is symmetric and doesn’t distinguish between causation or directionality.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Distance correlation is easier to understand and compare scores across different data sets, but mutual information can understand more complex non-linear relationships. So either can be helpful. Dealers choice on what you want to use. Let’s calculate a mutual information score on our external regressors and their lags.</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Variable 1</th>
<th>Variable 2</th>
<th>Mutual Information</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Revenue</td>

<td>0.00</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Revenue</td>
<td>xreg2_lag_12</td>
<td>0.00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Similar to regular correlation, xreg1 shows a strong relationship with revenue. But for MI it only has a relationship with lag 0 and lag 1. All other values are either very small or zero, meaning there is not strong relationship. This differs from the original correlation values. Usually it’s a good idea to use a few of these methods together. If external regressors are flagged as important in more than one of these approaches, then it’s safe to say they have some predictive power for our target variable. So for our data we can keep xreg1 to use in our model and drop xreg2 since it’s mostly noise with no signal.</p>
</section>
<section id="dealing-with-binary-regressors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dealing-with-binary-regressors">Dealing With Binary Regressors</h3>
<p>There’s one final type of analysis we are missing. Sometimes adding simple binary variables as external regressors can result in major accuracy improvements. These are 1 or 0 values that can represent a certain event or action happening. For example you might have new product launches in random months throughout the year. These can be represented with a 1 when there is a product launch, and a 0 when there is not. Without this binary data, a model may pick up on trends and patterns that may not repeat in the future. Your business might thrive during the months leading up to the US presidential election, but that only comes around every four years. So giving the model context of those events is important.</p>
<p>An interesting binary regressor in recent years has been a COVID-19 flag. This shows when COVID was impacting the world the most. When looking at the chart of our time series above, we can see a large dip in 2020. So it looks like COVID has a potential effect. Let’s create a COVID flag with a value of 1 for every month in 2020 and a value of 0 for all other months. We will also create a second flag that contains random 1 and 0 values to see if we can determine which regressor is important to our specific time series.</p>
<p>We can calculate a mutual information score for each one.</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Variable 1</th>
<th>Variable 2</th>
<th>Mutual Information</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Revenue</td>
<td>COVID Flag</td>
<td>0.0033</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Revenue</td>
<td>Random Flag</td>
<td>0.0000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>While the mutual information score for COVID is small, it’s still above zero. Which proves that this COVID flag may help improve our models predictive performance.</p>
<p>Finally there are other ways to figure out the importance of external regressors, but most of them deal with training actual models. I’ll wait on discussing those techniques until we build up some more foundational knowledge and eventually get to the sections on models themselves. Stay tuned.</p>
</section>
<section id="reversal" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reversal">Reversal</h3>
<p>When working with external regressors, it’s important to approach correlations and relationships critically. A strong correlation might suggest a connection, but it does not prove causation. This distinction is crucial, as relying on variables without clear logical links to your target can mislead your analysis and undermine your forecast.</p>
<p>Another issue to watch for is multicollinearity. This happens when external regressors are highly correlated with one another. Models can struggle to differentiate the effects of variables that overlap significantly, leading to instability in coefficient estimates and diminished interpretability. To mitigate this, examine the correlations among your regressors before including them. If two variables are redundant, consider removing or transforming one to reduce redundancy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, external regressors should be chosen based on both statistical evidence and domain knowledge. They should have a clear, interpretable relationship with the target variable. Without this foundation, even the most promising-looking variables can introduce unnecessary complexity and noise.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Incorporating external regressors into your time series analysis can significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of your forecasts when done carefully. The methods discussed, including correlation analysis and mutual information, are essential tools for evaluating potential regressors. However, they should always be applied alongside sound reasoning and a thorough understanding of the business.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the relationship between external regressors and your target may not always be straightforward. Non-linear relationships, lags, and interactions with other variables often require additional exploration to capture their full impact. This underscores the importance of iterative experimentation and validation throughout the forecasting process.</p>
<p>As you refine your approach, prioritize quality over quantity. A well-selected set of regressors tailored to the problem at hand will yield better results than an overly broad or poorly vetted selection. The goal is not just to improve the model’s performance but to ensure that the improvements are grounded in meaningful insights.</p>
<p>In time series forecasting, the integration of external regressors bridges the gap between historical patterns and the broader forces shaping the future. By combining statistical rigor with contextual understanding, you can build models that not only predict but also provide actionable insights into the dynamics of your business.</p>

  <title>80/20 SaaS: Why AI-Driven Customization Is the Future</title>

<section id="introduction-will-ai-kill-saas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-will-ai-kill-saas">Introduction: Will AI Kill SaaS?</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced to a point where one or two developers, working with AI-generated code, can build functional software in a matter of weeks. That prospect has led some to conclude that it spells the end of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). After all, why rent a platform if you can build a decent alternative in-house—cheaply and on-demand?</p>
<p>However, I believe there’s a more practical way forward. Instead of entirely replacing SaaS with AI-built tools, <strong>SaaS providers should deliver 80% of the core features</strong> and allow customers to <strong>customize the remaining 20%</strong> via AI. This approach maintains the convenience of off-the-shelf software while offering personalized functionality.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-some-believe-ai-will-kill-saas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-some-believe-ai-will-kill-saas">Why Some Believe AI Will Kill SaaS</h2>
<p>The primary argument for “AI replacing SaaS” goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Development Costs:</strong> With AI writing boilerplate code, you need fewer developers.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Faster Time to Market:</strong> AI can generate basic functionality quickly.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Tailored Features:</strong> Instead of dealing with generic solutions, an in-house AI tool can theoretically be customized to meet specific business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>On paper, this sounds like a dream come true for businesses. But the reality is more complicated. Building robust, production-grade software, from scratch, requires <strong>significant resources</strong>, including project management, maintenance, and ongoing support. Most companies aren’t equipped (or willing) to handle the long-term overhead that comes with building and hosting complex systems themselves.</p>
</section>
<section id="embracing-the-8020-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embracing-the-8020-model">Embracing the 80/20 Model</h2>
<p>Rather than viewing AI and SaaS as competing forces, I propose a hybrid model. The <strong>80/20 approach</strong> involves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Core Product (80%)</strong>
<ul>
<li>SaaS providers develop and maintain a set of core features that almost every customer needs. Think user authentication, data storage, basic dashboards, etc. This allows them to keep their development teams lean and focus on rock-solid functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Customer Customization (20%)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Customers then use AI (offered as part of the SaaS platform) to build out the features that are specific to their individual business needs. This might involve specialized workflows, custom dashboards, or niche integrations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>By dividing responsibilities this way, the SaaS provider avoids bloating its product with endless feature requests. Customers, in turn, get <strong>exactly what they want</strong> without having to pay for an army of developers.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-crm-example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-crm-example">A CRM Example</h2>
<p>Consider Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Giants like Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics offer thousands of features, but not every company needs each one. Despite the vast customization options, many organizations still find themselves <strong>adapting to the CRM</strong>, not the other way around.</p>
<p>What if a startup CRM provider offers a bare-bones product that covers 80% of what most sales teams require. Things like contact management, basic analytics, and lead tracking, and then <strong>invites customers to build the rest</strong> with AI-driven tools? For instance:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A sales manager wants automated follow-up emails that adapt to different time zones.<br>
</li>
<li>She types her request into the built-in AI feature: “Generate customized follow-up emails that go out at optimal local times for each lead.”<br>
</li>
<li>The AI creates this functionality on the fly, integrating it seamlessly into the CRM interface.</li>
</ol>
<p>No waiting for lengthy releases, no large development staff. Just a straightforward 80% solution with a customizable 20%.</p>

<section id="for-saas-providers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="for-saas-providers">For SaaS Providers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lean Development Team:</strong> Focus on a stable core, lowering overhead.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Feature Creep:</strong> No more chasing every edge case. Let AI and customers handle that final 20%.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>New Revenue Streams:</strong> Providers can charge a flat monthly fee for the core product plus incremental fees for AI-built custom features.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="for-customers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="for-customers">For Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster Customization:</strong> No waiting for your feature request to pass through the SaaS provider’s roadmap.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Lower Costs:</strong> Pay for essential features plus only the custom pieces you really need.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Risk:</strong> Save time and money by not building entire applications from scratch.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="potential-challenges" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potential-challenges">Potential Challenges</h2>
<p>Of course, the 80/20 model comes with its own complexities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Maintenance of Custom Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI-generated features could break when the core platform updates. SaaS providers will need robust versioning and testing to ensure stability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Security &amp; Compliance</strong>
<ul>
<li>As customers add custom modules, the platform must ensure data remains secure and compliant with regulations like GDPR.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Quality Control</strong>
<ul>
<li>Who is responsible when an AI-built feature malfunctions? Customers will demand that providers offer at least minimal support for AI-generated functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Training Data &amp; Privacy</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI systems rely on data to learn. Providers must have clear policies on how user data is used to train and improve models.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="startups-vs.-giants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="startups-vs.-giants">Startups vs.&nbsp;Giants</h2>
<p>This business model has the potential to disrupt established SaaS giants. Companies like Salesforce and Microsoft <strong>already offer</strong> highly customizable platforms, but they are weighed down by <strong>thousands of existing features</strong>. Re-engineering their entire codebase to an AI-first platform would be like trying to rebuild an airplane in mid-flight.</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>new startups</strong>:<br>
- <strong>Clean Slate:</strong> They can design products from the ground up with an 80/20 approach.<br>
- <strong>Modern Architectures:</strong> They can embed AI customization layers from day one, rather than retrofitting existing systems.<br>
- <strong>Agile Mindset:</strong> Less legacy overhead means they can pivot faster to market demands.</p>
<p>The incumbents won’t disappear overnight, but they may lose out on smaller, more agile customers who prefer a streamlined, customizable experience.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion-thriving-in-an-ai-future" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-thriving-in-an-ai-future">Conclusion: Thriving in an AI Future</h2>
<p>AI may not spell the end of SaaS, but it <strong>will</strong> transform it. By offloading the final 20% of custom features to AI, SaaS providers can remain lean, stay focused on a reliable core, and still give customers the freedom to adapt software to their unique processes.</p>
<section id="final-thought" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3>
<p>Are you ready to adapt? If you’re a <strong>SaaS provider</strong>, consider slimming your product down to the essential core and building out an AI-driven customization layer. If you’re a <strong>customer</strong>, think about the time and money you could save by adopting an 80/20 approach, rather than building or buying bloated software.</p>
<p>The future of SaaS will hinge on who best embraces this new reality. Those who see AI not as a rival to existing software, but as an ally in creating truly personal, on-demand solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Which side of the 80/20 equation is your business on?</strong></p>

  <title>Who Ya Gonna Call? ChatGPT!</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-12-19-who-ya-gonna-call/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>OpenAI has gotten into the holiday spirit by launching <a href="https://openai.com/12-days/">12 Days of OpenAI</a>. Each day at 10am PST they release a new product or feature to the world. We are currently on day 11 of their 12 day ship’mas extravaganza. Previous days have seen massive product launches of their new Sora video model and ChatGPT Search. The most exciting one of them all though has been the product they launched yesterday on day 10, something called 1-800-chatgpt.</p>
<p>You can now, toll free, call ChatGPT on any phone in the United States. For people outside of the US you can talk to it via WhatsApp. How cool is that! No account or credit card required. Just a friend you can phone 24/7 for whatever you need. This may seem like a small gimmicky feature but it’s actually one of their most profound launches to date, because now everyone has easy access to AI.</p>
<p>Nothing is truly mainstream until our parents, and to an extent our grandparents, start using the technology. My grandpa lives on a small farm in Kansas. He has no WiFi at his house, and most days he keeps his cell phone turned off and in a drawer. He does use his landline phone every day though. With this latest launch he can now talk to the most powerful language model in the world, using only his voice. No set up necessary, just call and chat. AI has jumped the walled garden of the internet and is getting embedded into more aspects of our lives. Now it can live as a contact in our phones. The barrier to entry on AI is getting closer to zero.</p>
<p>In addition to having the technically challenged use AI, there are countless other use cases of the new toll free AI number.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Anywhere there is poor cell service. Stranded in the middle of Montana with a flat tire? The ChatGPT app may not work but you might be able to make a phone call. Now the AI can walk you through step by step how to change that flat tire, all for free.</li>
<li>Find yourself in jail for a crime you were wrongly convicted for? The AI can be your one phone call, and might give you better advice than a paid lawyer.</li>
<li>Are you one question away from untold riches on “Who wants to be a millionaire?” Phone your AI friend and have them provide an immediate answer to win the cash prize.</li>
</ol>
<p>The power of AI is now available to everyone. No one knows what will happen when every human has equal access to limitless intelligence. Now we are one step closer. If you’ve never tried out ChatGPT before, get out your phone and make the call!</p>

  <title>ChatGPT Pro is Cheap</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-12-06-chatgpt-pro-is-cheap/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The latest offering from OpenAI costs $200 a month, and it’s actually a steal. It’s called <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/">ChatGPT Pro</a> and it’s 10x more expensive than their existing paid product called ChatGPT Plus. That sounds like a steep price tag but if you write code or do any complex reasoning for a living it could well be worth it.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the math. The average software engineer in the United States <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/software-engineer/salaries">get’s paid $105,000 a year</a>. In Seattle and SF that can be 2-3x higher. But let’s just use the average. The new ChatGPT Pro subscription costs around 2% of their annual salary. To be worth it the product needs to give them back the same amount in productivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>$105,000 salary</li>
<li>250 days worked a year (50 weeks of 5 days, 2 weeks for vacation)</li>
<li>$420 daily salary (105000/250)</li>
</ul>
<p>If a dev makes $420 a day writing code, then paying $2,400 a year for ChatGPT Pro equals out to just under 6 days of their salary. The new models offered in ChatGPT Pro are the best in the world at coding. So it’s safe to say using them will make a developer more productive. If using the service saves you one hour a week in time spent coding then it will have already paid for itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>200x12 = $2,400</li>
<li>2,400/420 = 5.7 days</li>
<li>5.7x8 = 46 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>So by using the service you are technically getting 6 more hours of yearly productivity for free, which is about $315. Using the new service is actually putting more money in your pocket.</p>
<p>If you think paying buku bucks for services like this is stupid, well you are just not using them correctly. AI will become the most powerful form of leverage in the world, so not using it to its max today will only hurt you tomorrow. OpenAI said they will also be rolling out more features to the pro service going forward. This could include access to the next generation of models like GPT5 and access to their upcoming agents capabilities. Once these come out you will gladly fork over thousands a month for them, because they will allow you to get 2-3x more done. So paying $200 a month now might just be a steal.</p>

<p>I love reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, you name it. Anything learning related is my jam. But I recently realized that if I don’t take notes on what I’m learning, I will probably forget everything. Now when I hear something interesting, I write it down in an Apple note for that month. Below are some of the learnings I jotted down in November, summarized by ChatGPT. I hope you find them as interesting as I did.</p>
<section id="personal-growth-and-mindset" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-growth-and-mindset">Personal Growth and Mindset</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Happiness and Presence</strong>: True happiness comes from being present and avoiding overthinking. Expectations play a big role in happiness: reality minus expectations equals happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Action and Results</strong>: Be impatient with actions but patient with results. Start quickly, but allow time for outcomes. Enthusiasm and belief are competitive advantages. Avoid the vicious cycle of inaction fueled by doubt.</li>
<li><strong>Overthinking</strong>: Rumination is the #1 symptom of depression. Action is a better way to change your thoughts than overthinking.</li>
<li><strong>Quotes on Mindset</strong>:
<ul>
<li>“Knowledge is knowing what to do; wisdom is doing it.”</li>
<li>“Cynics get to be right, optimists get to be rich.”</li>
<li>“Ask a better question, get a better answer.”</li>
<li>“At the end of the day you’re going to feel some type of way. So why not feel unbeatable. Why not feel untouchable. Why not feel like the best to ever do it.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="productivity-and-decision-making" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="productivity-and-decision-making">Productivity and Decision-Making</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Frameworks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Time between deciding and acting defines success.</li>
<li>Be clear on priorities: what you choose to work on is more important than how hard you work.</li>
<li>Use tools like the Dickens Method to evaluate how today’s actions affect your future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Worry Management</strong>: Schedule a time to worry instead of letting it linger. Outside of that window, maintain a zero-worry mindset.</li>
<li><strong>Teams and Companies</strong>: Companies should be viewed as sports teams, not families—performance matters. Be clear about whether a role requires a commando (startup mindset), soldier (scaling), or policeman (stability).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="business-and-sales" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="business-and-sales">Business and Sales</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product-Market Fit</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Before product-market fit: founders must engage directly with customers in unscalable ways.</li>
<li>After product-market fit: scale with sales staff and established processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sales Approach</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Use the problem-solution-specifics framework. If the customer disagrees about the problem, drop them.</li>
<li>“Reality vs.&nbsp;narrative” moments are key opportunities for emerging tech.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wealth and Risk</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Wealth is a byproduct of knowledge.</li>
<li>Risk is what remains after considering every possible variable.</li>
<li>“Survive” is the golden rule for emerging technologies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="society-and-systems" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="society-and-systems">Society and Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Observations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Older industries prioritize regulation capture and splitting spoils over innovation.</li>
<li>Traditions can empower tyranny when unquestioned.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Homelessness and Addiction</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Addiction and trauma are major causes of death for homeless individuals. Programs like Haven for Hope in San Antonio show promise in recovery-based justice systems.</li>
<li>Fentanyl is a growing public health crisis, being 50x more addictive than heroin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Realities</strong>:
<ul>
<li>78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.</li>
<li>The first 15 years of mortgage payments largely benefit banks, not homeowners.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="storytelling-and-communication" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="storytelling-and-communication">Storytelling and Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power of Stories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Stories connect human brains like APIs. They involve intention, obstacle, and stakes.</li>
<li>The best podcasters are “vibe architects,” creating environments that feel like casual, engaging conversations.</li>
<li>Great tweets follow principles of truth, novelty, and conciseness while being opinionated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Music and Stories</strong>: Both resonate emotionally and inspire action.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="practical-knowledge-and-insights" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-knowledge-and-insights">Practical Knowledge and Insights</h3>

<li>Recruiting agencies charge ~25% of the first-year salary for hires.</li>
<li>Warren Buffet owns more treasury bills than the U.S. government.</li>
<li>Success is a window (external factors), and failure is a mirror (personal responsibility).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Teaching and Learning</strong>: Computer literacy has untapped potential. Teaching AI-based math instead of manual long division could redefine education.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="miscellaneous-wisdom" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="miscellaneous-wisdom">Miscellaneous Wisdom</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Tradition is the crown of the tyrant.”</li>
<li>“The larger the group, the worse the conversation.”</li>
<li>“Trying to think your way out of overthinking is like sniffing your way out of a cocaine addiction.”</li>

  <title>DIY Ozempic For 90% Less Cost</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-27-diy-ozempic/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>I’m not a doctor, I don’t play one on TV. This is not health advice. Make your own damn decisions.</em></p>
<p>It’s the day before Thanksgiving. Or as I like to think of it, the day before the month+ holiday eating binge. While it truly is the most wonderful time of the year to eat, it’s not the most healthy. I think everything should be moderation, including moderation. So I like to go nuts myself during this time of year and eat whatever. For most American’s though, going nuts on food for a month straight is not a good idea. Most are obese, and have been that way for decades.</p>
<p>Thankfully new weight loss medicines like Ozempic have risen in popularity over the last few years. These drugs contain a hormone called GLP-1. Which is something your body produces naturally. It’s what makes you feel full after eating a meal. If your body consumes this hormone from Ozempic, it will naturally make you feel full quicker. Which makes you less hungry. Which makes you eat less. Causing you to lose weight. Seems like a miracle drug right! Unfortunately <a href="https://tim.blog/2024/02/02/no-biological-free-lunches/">there are no free lunches</a> in the world of biology. It always comes with a catch. For drugs like Ozempic the catch has to do with it’s price ($1,000 a month) and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/ozempic-side-effects#long-term-side-effects">potential impact on major organs</a> like your thyroid, pancreas, and heart. But if you’re 100 pounds overweight, your organs are already suffering, so taking the drug knowing the tradeoffs is probably worth the risk. Being overweight is bad, mmmk?</p>
<p>The rise in these drugs has definitely caught my attention, so I’ve been studying them closer. They have the potential to not just make people more healthy, but their downstream impacts can be enormous. Planes may not need as much fuel on flights, because people onboard will weigh less. McDonald’s stock might drop 50% because people aren’t impulsively buying milkshakes after work each day. Even gyms could close down, because people can now look good while only taking a pill/shot versus doing 45 min on the stairmaster every day. There will be countless effects. Both good and bad.</p>
<p>What if you could get all of the good effects from Ozempic without having to pay an arm and a leg while also avoiding the harmful side effects? I think I’ve come across a combination that will naturally produce more GLP-1 in your body, while also being 1/10th the price of Ozempic. Here is the stack.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supergut-Prebiotic-Replacement-Strawberry-servings/dp/B0C645Q2CT/ref=sr_1_4_pp?crid=23XDI3ALKQLWE&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ftkuxSBzIaWukfVtnXPvZqBYlET7P_DPpqUuEN5VnUiOlBxfOMzcgkMiL86iJAQ0GeA0vssfvxntIN3Y-jpq2Jr_foimcrO1orPTmc26vPj0zWYqPcTnejj0MwKQICLXWiwlEJSfJtTbo5Q2ENGCwCDK4rtNaAjM9UFz9e_ZJNsryI19XvCxIOYsn05ghGOoAHhr4dXeYIZOebY6ufrQyjSfcTU86deki-ovxQBnhDJTQFcD9aEjuI9cMrhEkIUFg-tKC7DY1nrwm6puUBFgl8nXXy17KZ_zWO8J3keUr8A.RYEHioYWLX2J2QAdYpL0AlnSLvNF7ys-Tw_dT4tW3QA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=supergut&amp;qid=1732722580&amp;s=hpc&amp;sprefix=supergut%2Chpc%2C177&amp;sr=1-4">Prebiotic Shakes by Supergut</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY3VZDYP?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_8&amp;amp=&amp;crid=2T0LC4RNRX9EX&amp;amp=&amp;sprefix=pendulum">GLP-1 Probiotic by Pendulum</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve written about Supergut in a <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-15-hacking-blood-sugar/">previous post</a>. It’s a fiber supplement that contains prebiotic fiber that has been proven to stimulate the release of GLP-1 in your gut. Pendulum is a company specializing in supplements for your gut microbiome. Their GLP-1 probiotic contains living bacteria that creates the precursors to GLP-1. I first learned about Pendulum from <a href="https://www.kevinrose.com/p/a-natural-alternative-to-glp-1-drugs">Kevin Rose</a>, and the science behind it looks legit.</p>
<p>I think the combination of both could be a game changer. The prebiotic fiber from Supergut will help give your microbiome the food it needs to thrive. And the probiotics from Pendulum will help develop the right strains of bacteria in your gut that help produce more GLP-1. This one two punch could be very powerful. I don’t think they’ve been studied in combination before, so this could definitely be some bro science, but my research so far tells me it’s a good combination.</p>
<p>These two products combined cost around $100 a month, compared to $1,000 for Ozempic. So you don’t have much to lose by trying these products. At a minumum your bathroom visits will become 10x more productive and your microbiome will be better off. Why not try it and see how it might help you fight the good fight during this upcoming season of countless food temptations?</p>

<p>Having quality data helps produce quality forecasts. There’s an old saying in the data universe, <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-04-08-time-series-garbage/">garbage in, garbage out</a>. When your data is bad, you will get bad outcomes. The presence of missing data and outliers can reduce forecast accuracy. Which is a shame because they are so easy to fix.</p>
</section>
<section id="missing-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="missing-data">Missing Data</h3>
<p>Time series are unique from other types of data because they have a built in order, based on time. For this to work it’s important that each period of time is represented in the data. For example with a monthly data set spanning five years, we want there to be no missing value for any of the month’s during those five years. Having missing values creates challenges when trying to analyze and model the data, since most statistical and machine learning techniques assume all available time periods are present in the data. This leads to reduced forecast accuracy.</p>
<p>There are a few ways data can be missing in a time series.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meaning: Data is missing for no specific reason, it’s just random. The missing data doesn’t depend on any pattern or the actual value that’s missing.</li>
<li>Example: A sensor that records the temperature randomly fails to record a value now and then.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Missing at Random (MAR)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meaning: Data is missing for a reason that depends on other information you already have, but not on the missing values themselves. You can explain the missing data using the rest of the data.</li>
<li>Example: A temperature sensor is more likely to fail during hot weather, but the failure doesn’t depend on the exact temperature value it would have recorded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Not Missing at Random (NMAR)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meaning: Data is missing because of the value itself, it’s missing for a reason related to what’s not recorded. The missing data is biased, and you need to understand why it’s missing to deal with it.</li>
<li>Example: A temperature sensor doesn’t record very high temperatures because it shuts down when it overheats.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mixed Mechanisms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meaning: Missing data can be a mix of random, explainable, and biased causes.</li>
<li>Example: Some values are randomly missed due to glitches (MCAR), some during maintenance periods (MAR), and others during extreme weather (NMAR).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Most data I deal with is some combination of missing completely at random or not missing at random. For example there might be a months worth of revenue data missing in a system due to issues with the company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. So that data is missing completely at random. A system error created the missing data. Another example is having monthly revenue for three products, where two of the products have five full years of revenue data and the other only has the last three years of data. This is due to that third product being newer and only being sold in the last three years. So that data is not missing at random but is due to a specific reason.</p>
<p>For the first two types of missing data (#1 and #2 in the list), it’s a good idea to use some sort of simple statistical model to interpolate what the missing value should be based on actual values on either side of the data. Below is a monthly time series from our example data. I removed a few months at random. We can use a statistical model that breaks down the time series by trend, seasonality, and residual. Then predict what the missing value should be based on the existing trend and seasonal components.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-26-ts-fundamentals-missing-outliers/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-26-ts-fundamentals-missing-outliers/chart2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For the third type of missing data, it’s usually a good idea to go talk to the owner of that data. Maybe missing data in a system is simply due to that observation having a value of 0, so to save memory they just don’t record that value in the system. The easy fix there is to go in and replace those values with zero. You might have some time series in your dataset that are shorter than others. For example, most of your time series could have five years of monthly data, but one may have only the recent three years of monthly data. To deal with this, you could also replace those missing values with 0. That way each time series is the same length. This becomes important later on when we want to start back testing different models to analyze forecast accuracy.</p>
<p>After you replace the missing data, it’s also a good idea to flag where missing values were originally. This can be done with a simple binary variable added to your dataset. Showing a value of 1 when the original data point was missing, and 0 when it wasn’t. This allows us to give this information to a model, and have it adapt to the changes we made in the data.</p>

<section id="outliers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outliers">Outliers</h3>
<p>Outliers are values in a time series that depart from the norm. They can be extremely high or low values. Having outliers in your time series can worsen forecast accuracy. A model may try to learn the new changes in trend/seasonality caused by an outlier and carry them forward into the future forecast. We don’t want that. Instead we should identify when outliers occur and do our best at dealing with them.</p>
<p>There are a few ways we can spot outliers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Smell Test</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use our domain knowledge to point out values that don’t make sense after inspecting the time series on a chart. For example, a temperature of 150°F in Seattle may not be physically possible. It doesn’t pass our smell test, and so we can flag it manually as an outlier.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Statistical Methods</strong>
<ul>
<li>Calculate statistical measures like Z-scores and interquartile ranges (IQR) to spot data points that are outside of standard ranges.</li>
<li>The <strong>Z-score method</strong> identifies outliers by measuring how far a data point is from the mean, in terms of standard deviations, with values typically beyond 3 considered outliers.</li>
<li>The <strong>Interquartile Range (IQR)</strong> is a measure of statistical dispersion and represents the middle 50% of the data. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3), which is the value below which 75% of the data lies, and the first quartile (Q1), which is the value below which 25% of the data lies. The IQR method identifies outliers as data points that fall outside Q1−1.5×IQR (too low) or Q3+1.5×IQR (too high). This method works well for skewed or non-normal data because it uses the quartiles, which are less affected by extreme values than the mean or standard deviation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Residual Methods</strong>
<ul>
<li>Residual methods, such as those used in <strong>STL decomposition</strong> (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS), identify outliers by isolating the residuals after removing trend and seasonality from a time series. STL splits a time series into three components:
<ol type="a">
<li>Trend: The long-term movement or pattern in the data.</li>
<li>Seasonal: Repeating patterns or cycles at fixed frequencies.</li>
<li>Residual: The remaining random noise or deviations after subtracting the trend and seasonal components.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Outliers are detected in the residuals, which represent the part of the data that cannot be explained by the trend or seasonal patterns. Typically, residuals that fall outside a certain threshold, such as ±3 standard deviations or another robust range, are flagged as outliers. This method is particularly effective for time series data as it accounts for both trend and seasonality, ensuring that outliers are not mistaken for normal patterns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning Methods</strong>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning methods identify outliers by training models to learn the normal patterns in the data and then flagging deviations from these patterns. These methods include:
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Isolation Forest</strong>: This tree-based algorithm isolates data points by creating random partitions. Outliers are points that require fewer splits to isolate, as they differ significantly from the rest of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Autoencoders</strong>: Neural networks are trained to reconstruct the time series. Data points with high reconstruction errors (i.e., the model struggles to recreate them) are flagged as outliers.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering</strong>: Algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN group similar data points into clusters. Outliers are points that either belong to sparse or distant clusters or are classified as noise by the algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Probabilistic Models</strong>: Techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) assign probabilities to data points based on how well they fit the learned distribution, flagging low-probability points as outliers.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Machine learning methods are powerful because they can handle non-linear, multi-dimensional, and non-Gaussian patterns, making them highly effective for complex time series. However, they require careful tuning and may need more data than simpler statistical approaches.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s use the residual method and see if we can spot a few outliers in our time series. First we will <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-06-ts-fundamentals-decomposition/">decompose our time series</a>, then see what residuals are 3 or more standard deviations away from the average.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-26-ts-fundamentals-missing-outliers/chart3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-26-ts-fundamentals-missing-outliers/chart4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>There seems to be on major outlier in mid 2020, shown as outside of the dotted upper and lower range. Which is not surprising since our smell test could have told us the same thing. COVID-19 in 2020 was most likely the cause for the sudden change in trend and seasonality for those periods around 2020. We can now confirm it with the residual method for spotting outliers. How cool is that!</p>
<p>Once we know the outliers in our data, there is a few things we can do to handle them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Do Nothing</strong>: Leave it alone, and let its presence impact our future forecast. This is a good approach if there is a structural change in the time series that you expect to carry onward in the future. For example COVID might have caused a permanent work from home revolution, which could impact your business that relies on growth in office space. So leaving it alone would give the model insight into a change that is expected to continue in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Flag It</strong>: Similar to flagging missing values, we can add a binary variable to our dataset. A value of 1 to indicate an outlier occurred, and a 0 when it did not. This will allow our model to understand true one time events that are not expected to happen again in the future. Making it less likely for a model to learn the change in pattern. COVID-19 was truly a one off thing, so flagging the outliers could be helpful for our time series.</li>
<li><strong>Remove It</strong>: Remove the outlier, and treat it like a missing value. You can then use the methods discussed earlier to fill in the missing value with something that is more in line with future trends and seasonality. Combining this method with adding an outlier flag from #2 is a solid approach.</li>
</ol>

<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Handling the presence of missing values and outliers can sometimes be more art than science, so always make sure to be adaptable in using the right approach for your use case. When done correctly, cleaning your data of missing values and outliers can help you understand your data while improving forecast accuracy.</p>

  <title>Hacking My Blood Sugar With Fiber</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-15-hacking-blood-sugar/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For years, I’d heard about continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) , mostly from health enthusiasts on podcasts. These small devices, which attach to your upper arm, measure blood glucose (blood sugar) every five minutes and send the data to your phone via Bluetooth. Originally developed for diabetics who need to monitor their blood glucose throughout the day, CGMs are now becoming popular among non-diabetics as a tool to track metabolic health.</p>
<p>Metabolic health refers to how well your body processes and manages energy from food. Good metabolic health means your body efficiently converts food into energy without putting too much strain on organs like the heart, pancreas, liver, and muscles. People with optimal metabolic health typically have stable blood sugar, good insulin sensitivity, healthy cholesterol levels, and normal blood pressure. Poor metabolic health can increase the risk of conditions like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and obesity.</p>
<p>Key indicators of metabolic health often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood sugar levels - Balanced glucose levels without spikes or drops.</li>
<li>Blood pressure - Normal range without requiring medication.</li>
<li>Cholesterol and triglycerides - Healthy levels that reduce risk of cardiovascular issues.</li>
<li>Waist circumference - Indicates abdominal fat, linked to higher risk of metabolic disorders.</li>
<li>Insulin sensitivity - Ability to regulate blood sugar without excessive insulin release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a CGM to track blood glucose (BG) is a great way to gauge metabolic health. When your BG stays within a healthy range (70-140 mg/dl), your body functions optimally. Repeatedly leaving that range can lead to serious consequences. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/communication-resources/diabetes-statistics.html#:~:text=Diabetes%201%20Diabetes%20About%2038%20million%20people%20have,health%20complications%3A%20...%205%20Common%20Types%20of%20Diabetes">Over 1/3 of Americans</a> have either diabetes or prediabetes, with many unaware of their condition. Heart disease is the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/leading-causes-of-death">leading cause of death</a>, accounting for 20% of all deaths in America. These illnesses, with the exception of type 1 diabetes, can be mitigated with good metabolic health, which involves maintaining stable BG throughout the day.</p>
<p>A few months back I purchased a CGM device, <a href="https://www.stelo.com/en-us">made by Dexcom</a>, to start tracking my BG. I did it for a few reasons. A family member of mine has type 1 diabetes, so I wanted to see how my own BG levels look throughout the day. While also test driving to device before recommending it to them. I also wanted to understand how certain foods impact my blood sugar. I’ve heard on podcasts that you’d be surprised what kinds of foods impact your BG. Which is different for everyone. Some foods people thought as healthy, like bananas, might send their BG spiking. Finally, if I could get a better handle on my BG, I could also get better control of my energy throughout the day. When your BG spikes above the normal range, it will eventually come crashing down. Going far lower than the normal range. This spike and fall of BG leads many people to have energy crashes throughout the day. This saps their energy, while also giving them cravings to eat more food. This is a vicious cycle. And one that I wanted to break.</p>
<p>I purchased the CGM from Dexcom and slapped it on my arm. It didn’t hurt to apply and after a few minutes I forgot it was even there. One device lasts for about 15 days so every couple of weeks you have to switch it out for a new one. I now got a stream of data every five minutes alerting me to my BG level. For a data nerd like me it was awesome. I quickly become some sort of mad scientist. Eating things at random and seeing how my BG changed in the next 60 minutes. The findings for my body were very straight forward. If I ate processed junk, my BG would spike. If I ate unprocessed whole food, my BG would stay stable. As long as I didn’t eat processed food, my BG would stay in the healthy range. There is just one problem though, I love junk food.</p>
<p>Everything in moderation, including moderation. Right? I usually try to eat clean +90% of the week. But I am human, and love to pig out every once in a while. I have been known to subscribe to the practice known as “Faturday”. Where for one day of the week I go absolutely nuts and eat everything in site. This kind of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013114/barbell-investment-strategy.asp">barbell strategy</a>, either eating 100% clean or 100% junk, has kept me in balance over the years. It keeps me on track of my health goals without being too much of a stickler. The only downside of this approach is the massive hits my BG takes on the days I let loose. Once I got the CGM I could see the roller coaster ride my BG would take on these cheat days, and I could match my mood and energy level with where my BG was at the time. This made me think more about ways I could control my BG when I wanted to treat myself, without putting myself at risk of the consequences of poor BG management.</p>
<p>There are a few tried and true ways to control your BG. The first, and most boring, is to just eat healthy unprocessed foods. A second way is to incorporate movement into your day after eating. Simply <a href="https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/walking/blood-sugar-walking/">going on a walk after eating</a> can have a profound impact on stabilizing your blood glucose. The same goes for more intense movement like lifting weights or cardio. These two strategies are strong, but they didn’t help me when I wanted to treat myself. I quickly learned that it’s hard to outrun a donut you just ate. That’s when I came across a third way to control BG.</p>
<p>A favorite podcast of mine is called <a href="https://allin.com/">All In</a>. It features four men who are titans in Silicon Valley. From founders of Paypal to early Facebook and Google employees, these guys know their stuff. During one episode I learned about a supplement company one of the members of the podcast invested in, called <a href="https://supergut.com/">Super Gut</a>. The company is all about fiber, which sounds like the worlds most boring supplement, but in reality has countless benefits. It turns out that 95% of Americans do not consume enough fiber, which is around 30 grams a day. So we all need to look for more ways to consume more fiber.</p>
<p>Super Gut uses prebiotic fiber found in foods like green bananas, oats, and potatoes. This preobiotic fiber is the best kind of food to provide your gut microbiome, since it can’t be converted into fuel for your body like other macronutrients. Fiber is bulky, so it easily expands to fill your stomach, causing a feeling of being full. It also slows your digestion, which can prolong the feeling of being full, and has the additional benefit of regulating your BG. Finally, there have been recent findings that show consuming the right types of fiber makes your body <a href="https://supergut.com/blog/natural-glp-1-how-to-produce-satiety-hormones-without-ozempic">release hormones like GLP-1</a>. This is the main ingredient behind booming drugs like Ozempic, used for weight loss. Why pay thousands for synthetic GLP-1 when you get get more of it naturally with fiber?</p>
<p>Each serving of the Super Gut shake contains 15 grams of fiber, which is around 50% of the fiber we need each day. That’s a crap ton of fiber. To put that into perspective, you would have to eat about 5 medium sized potatoes (with skin on) to get the same amount of fiber. 10 seconds of consuming a fiber supplement compared to 20+ minutes of force feeding potatoes. The choice is easy.</p>
<p>How do I use it? First and foremost I use Super Gut to get the daily recommendation of fiber. Usually consuming a serving at the start of each day. Going from maybe 10 grams of daily fiber to 30+ is life changing in more ways then one. Bathroom trips get a lot more interesting. Any previous problems in that department gets solved immediately. What has surprised me the most is its impact on my blood sugar when I eat junk. When I treat myself on a Faturday, I first consume fiber, then eat whatever crap comes my way. Ice cream went from spiking my BG over 200 mg/dl to now only going up slightly to 130-140 mg/dl. Which is within the healthy range. That small spike is short lived, compared to previous Faturday’s where my BG would spike for hours at a time. Now when I eat pizza, my responds like I’m eating chicken and rice. I usually have a 2-3 window after consuming fiber where I can eat junk without spiking my BG. It’s truly mind blowing.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-15-hacking-blood-sugar/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-15-hacking-blood-sugar/chart2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now this doesn’t mean you should go out and eat whatever you want, as long as you consume some fiber beforehand. Don’t do that. But when you do want to treat yourself on occasion, you can do so knowing that it won’t wreck your metabolic health. Try it for yourself! I’m sure there are other supplements besides Super Gut out there that can do the same thing. Regardless of whether you’re trying to pig out or not, getting more fiber into your life will improve your life in more ways than one.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-series-data-has-memory">Time Series Data Has Memory</h3>
<p>The biggest factor that differentiates a time series from another form of data is order. Each observation in a time series is ordered by well, you guessed it, time. Because of this order, there are unique relationships that develop in the data. Let’s take temperature for example. If today’s temperature is 70°F, and the temperature in the previous seven days was around 65-80, what do you think the temperature tomorrow will be? Probably not below freezing. It’ll most likely be similar to the temperature today. This memory about the past is one of the most powerful concepts in time series forecasting. It’s the concept of autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Autocorrelation is when a value in a time series is related to previous values in that series. In simple terms, it measures how much the current value depends on past values. For example, if high temperatures today make it likely to have high temperatures tomorrow, the temperature series has a positive autocorrelation.</p>
</section>
<section id="calculating-autocorrelation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calculating-autocorrelation">Calculating Autocorrelation</h3>
<p>Getting the autocorrelation is as simple as computing the correlation of the existing time series with a lagged time series. For example let’s take a time series from our example data set, shown below.</p>

<p>We can create lags of one month, two months, and onwards. Then calculate the correlation between the original time series (with a lag of 0) and these new lagged time series. The results of that process are shown below, with a lag up to 24 months.</p>

<p>Correlation is shown on the y-axis and the lag amount is shown on the x-axis. The chart shows high autocorrelation for a lag of 0, 1, 12, and 24 months. A lag of 0 has a perfect correlation because it’s the exact same as the original time series. These lag correlations are shown as positive values, meaning that there is a positive correlation with the original time series. There are also above the shaded blue region of the chart. This shaded region is a confidence interval. This confidence interval helps us filter out lags that are not statistically significant, meaning they don’t have a correlation due to random chance. Any lag outside of the shaded region is significant and should have a real relationship with our original time series.</p>

<p>Autocorrelation has one fatal flaw though. It can provide misleading correlations since it doesn’t account for correlations between lags. For example, there might be a very strong correlation with the original time series and lag 1 of the time series. Because of this correlation, there is a good chance that a lag 2 also shows a strong correlation. The lag 2 correlation might only be due to lag 2 having similar information to lag 1. So the end results could be misleading.</p>
<p>To account for this, partial autocorrelation was created. This process takes into account the correlations between lags. Making sure that the end correlations are only connected to the original time series. It is the preferred method of analyzing autocorrelation. So make sure it’s part of your time series tool kit. Here is the partial autocorrelation of our example time series.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deeper look at the partial autocorrelation and see what insights it might provide. When looking at the partial autocorrelation chart, the biggest correlation is at lag 0. This makes sense since a lag of 0 is just the original time series, so there will be a perfect correlation of 1. Lag 1 shows a strong correlation, which makes sense, since it’s contains values closest to the original series. There are also strong correlations at lag 11, 12, and 13. This confirms our data has strong seasonality. The highest correlation is at lag 12, which means values today are highly correlated to values at the same time in the previous year (12 months ago). This information will be invaluable when we start to build models in the future.</p>

<p>Having strong partial autocorrelation in your time series will always lead to more accurate future forecasts. Especially if you expect <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-04-11-time-series-past-future/">the future to be similar to the past</a>. If your data has little or no correlation with historical lags, then it will be more difficult to train accurate models to forecast the future. Calculating partial autocorrelation should always be one of the first things you do when working with time series. It’s quickest way to start building intuition about your data.</p>
