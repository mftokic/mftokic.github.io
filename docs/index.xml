<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="democratize---delegate">Democratize -&gt; Delegate</h3>
<p>I’ve worked on machine learning (ML) forecasting for most of my career. The biggest opportunity I’ve found to scale the impact of machine learning was to <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-07-15-msft-ml-fcst-journey-3/">democratize the technology</a> to an average person with no technical or coding background. Each user could become their own citizen data scientist. But now I’m starting to rethink that. Instead of trying to teach humans how to use AI/ML tools, how can we teach AI to use these tools? <strong>Shouldn’t AI be the best at using AI?</strong> I think so. This shifts my initial idea of <strong>democratizing to now delegating</strong> the task of creating ML forecasts to AI agents who can work on them 24/7. Having this full time virtual data scientist working for humans will have profound effects on the future of forecasting.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-forecasting-with-machine-learning-is-hard-in-finance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-forecasting-with-machine-learning-is-hard-in-finance">Why Forecasting with Machine Learning is Hard in Finance</h3>
<p>Before we discuss the promise of new AI agents, let’s review why the current state of democratizing is hard to do. Most of the roadblocks to ML adoption end up in two buckets.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Not Enough Time</strong>: Finance people are too busy doing their current jobs to learn how to do it any other way. They don’t have time to learn to use new tools. No time to analyze the ML output alongside their traditional forecast methods. Even if they wanted to use the democratized ML tools (or even have a data science do it for them) the process of iterating to find the best combination of data inputs and ML techniques takes up too much time.</li>
<li><strong>Black Box</strong>: There’s a certain leap of faith that needs to happen when using ML. Before with traditional excel models, a finance person could trace cell by cell how a specific forecast number was created. This goes out the window with ML. Making it harder to explain the forecasts to business partners and be accountable if the ML forecast is inaccurate. Either the finance person needs to be technical enough to explain the ML process and output or they need to come to someone like me to “read the ML tea leaves” for them to help understand the forecast output.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="cant-llms-create-forecasts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cant-llms-create-forecasts">Can’t LLMs Create Forecasts?</h3>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking to yourself “I thought everyone is saying these new large language models (LLM) from places like OpenAI are close to superintelligence, can’t they just create the forecast for us?”. LLMs are good at text, not numbers. You cannot simply give them historical revenue data and expect them to output a sophisticated forecast. It will not work with today’s models. There are some companies like <a href="https://www.nixtla.io/">Nixtla</a> who have created generative AI models that are specific to time series that are worth looking into, but we’re still in the early days of these models.</p>
<p>Instead of training humans to use democratized ML tools, can we train AI to use the tools? This is where AI agents come into play. Think of them as LLMs who can call various tools and APIs on their own autonomously to accomplish a goal set by a human. In a sense they are like hiring a contractor or intern to go work on something for you, maybe check in from time to time, and continue to work for days or weeks until they finish the task.</p>
</section>
<section id="are-ai-agents-the-answer" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-ai-agents-the-answer">Are AI Agents The Answer?</h3>
<p>AI agents that can create forecasts will be like having a virtual data scientist right out of the box ready to go 24/7. Every finance person can have an agent working for them around the clock. Constantly iterating and updating their forecasts to make them more accurate and easier to understand. Agents will solve both of the biggest challenges in adopting ML forecasts. They fix the lack of time problem by being able to run 24/7 and at scale across the cloud. They also can help fix the black box problem by being able to easily explain any ML output in plain english to a user. This “chat with your forecast” capability will help teach finance users how ML works and help build their “ML intuition”. Let’s see what an AI forecast agent can actually do.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-can-an-ai-forecast-agent-do" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-can-an-ai-forecast-agent-do">What Can an AI Forecast Agent Do?</h3>
<p>Here are all of the “skills” or “workflows” I imagine an AI agent being able to do for finance users. Some require connecting to other agents, while others are self-contained within the realm of the forecast agent.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Research</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being able to find and pull data to use in the ML forecast process. This is most likely done through a separate agent that specializes in this. For example, having an internal data agent in your company that allows other agents to connect to it and pull financial data from your core reporting systems.</li>
<li>Run analysis on potential things that are impacting your business, and therefore your forecast. For example, understanding the current state of tariffs, and how their impact should be reflected in the ML forecast. Either by adding input data around tariffs or applying some sort of adjustment after the ML forecast process runs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Formatting</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once you have some data you want to use to produce a ML forecast, transform it in the right ways to make it easy for the ML forecast process to learn from the data and produce an accurate forecast.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li>Teach the LLM about your data set. Run all of the <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-10-03-ts-fundamentals-eda/">classic EDA techniques</a> and provide that information to the AI agent so it knows about the trends and patterns in your historical data.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forecast Iteration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allow the AI agent to start running ML forecasts on your behalf. This is where it connects to existing AutoML like tools where it can kick off new ML runs, analyze the forecast accuracy, and make tweaks to the data or ML inputs to get an even better forecast. The user can give the agent constraints around the maximum amount of runs it can do and the end goal of a forecast error it wants the agent to obtain.</li>
<li>Combining EDA with iteration is where the magic happens. This is where the agent can work 24/7 on constantly trying to improve the forecast and find new ways to make it even more accurate. This is how you get scalable impact by having a full time virtual data scientist working for you nonstop.</li>
<li>Most AutoML systems will optimize all time series at once. An AI agent can go one time series at a time, knowing exactly what inputs and ML parameters to use to get the maximum accuracy. Even in complex <a href="https://otexts.com/fpp3/hierarchical.html">hiearchical forecast</a> processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forecast Update</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once you have that optimized forecast from skill #4, you might need to create updated forecasts every month going forward. The agent can now take new data and combine with what created the best forecasts previously to update new forecasts on the fly. This kind of memory helps save time and resources by not needing to run the whole AutoML forecast process from scratch each time you need a new forecast.</li>
<li>Over time, inputs that initially created the most accurate forecast initially may now longer be relevant in creating the most accurate forecast going forward. The agent will be able to recognize when these forecasts deviate from historical accuracy and know when to properly retrain or even go back to the drawing board and try new forecast iterations to get back to the proper level of accuracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forecast Explanation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users can ask the agent questions about the forecast and get answers back in plain english. The agent can rely on learnings from the EDA process, previous forecast iterations, and its research capabilities to answer any question.</li>
<li>For tougher analysis questions asked by users, the agent will be able to write and execute code on the fly to return tables and charts that give greater insight into the forecast.</li>
<li>This kind of QnA capability allows finance users to increase their understanding of the ML forecast output, which increases their trust in ML. Over time as this trust builds they will want to use the ML output even more, since now they know it’s accurate and are able to explain the outputs to their business partners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forecast Transformation</strong>
<ul>
<li>After the final ML forecast is created, users can then instruct the agent to allocate it down to even more granular levels. For example a ML forecast might be created at a worldwide level, then be allocated down to a country level. All done intelligently and on the fly by the agent.</li>
<li>Users can also make high level manual adjustments to the forecast and the agent will correct apply them. For example a user may want to adjust a revenue forecast by 10 million, and the agent can take that amount and spread it correctly to each country based on predetermined seasonality or any other technique asked by the user.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scenario Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being able to ask “what if” questions about a ML forecast has been tough to do historically. It requires changes to the input data and feature engineering process to get the final outputs. But with an agent this all becomes a simple ask away. The agent will be able to adjust the data and re-run the ML forecast process based on the scenarios asked by the user and easily explain the changes in the forecast that arise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Variance Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li>If LLMs and agents can help us look into the future with forecasting, they can definitely help us look into the past and figure out the reasons why our forecast was different than what actually happened in the business for a specific quarter. Using ML to create future forecasts makes it easier to run variance analysis because everything is documented for the AI agent to sift through and understand. It knows exactly what historical data was used, what other ML params were chosen, and what the final ML models were that produced the forecast. It can fill in it’s gaps with its research skills to understand other internal and external factors that might have impacted the business as well. Making it easy to spot and explain forecast variances at scale.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p><a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-agent-manager/">Eventually all of us will be AI agent managers</a>. Being able to to build and wield these agents will become the ultimate source of leverage in business. Agents applied in the forecasting space have so much potential to help finance teams better plan and make decisions about the future. They will be able to work faster and do kinds of work never thought possible before.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on building AI agent capabilities directly into my <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/finnts/">automated ML forecast framework called Finn</a>. It’s completely open-source and free to use. Stay tuned for more updates if you’d like to use it!</p>

<ul>
<li>Dopamine is about <em>wanting</em> and <strong>anticipatory motivation</strong>, not the actual reward.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Reward-prediction error</strong> determines mood afterward:
<ul>
<li>Better than expected → extended high.<br>
</li>
<li>Worse than expected → crash below baseline.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rapid, high-magnitude spikes (meth, gambling, extreme porn) produce deep troughs, driving compulsive reuse.<br>
</li>
<li>Healthy strategy: create slower, effort-based climbs (learning, training, creative work) to avoid the crash.</li>

<ul>
<li>Online porn is the “methamphetamine” version of sex stimuli: intensity and novelty raise dopamine thresholds, making real intimacy feel flat.<br>
</li>
<li>Excess porn in adolescence rewires expectations during a period of peak neural plasticity (≈0-25 yrs).<br>
</li>
<li>Practical fixes:
<ul>
<li>Abstinence / “dopamine fast” periods to reset baseline.<br>
</li>
<li>Slow-build intimacy – multiple non-intercourse sessions before sex, emphasize communication and breathing to stay parasympathetic.<br>
</li>
<li>Treat erectile anxiety with openness, not immediate pharmacology; Tadalafil (2.5-5 mg) is helpful later in life, not as an early crutch.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nutrition-myths-debunked">2. Nutrition Myths Debunked</h3>
<p><em>Protein</em><br>
- “You can only absorb 30 g per meal.” → Human subjects assimilated <strong>100 g</strong> whey just as well as 25 g (labeled-leucine study, <em>Cell Metabolism</em> 2023). The surplus fuels protein synthesis for <strong>longer</strong>, not “wasted.”<br>
- “Anabolic window = 30 min post-lift.” → MPS is still climbing 6 h post-workout, peaks ~24 h.<br>
- “High protein hurts kidneys.” → No evidence in healthy kidneys; contraindicated only in late-stage disease. Longevity debate still open.</p>
<p><em>Meal frequency &amp; snacking</em><br>
- Frequent eating was popularized by bodybuilding; it <strong>mutes glucagon</strong>, never lets insulin fully drop and stalls fat mobilization.<br>
- DeLauer’s rule: <strong>clear, defined gaps</strong> between feedings—no Skittles “in the valley.”</p>
<p><em>Cortisol fear</em><br>
- Transient spikes (fasting, workouts) aid lipolysis and alertness; demonizing cortisol keeps trainees over-fed and under-trained.</p>
<p><em>Low-calorie grind</em><br>
- Chronic 1–200 kcal deficits backfire: metabolism adapts, muscle is lost, “cheat-meal” rebounds get stored as fat at a slower BMR.<br>
- <strong>High-energy flux</strong> (eat more + move more) outperforms <strong>eat less + move less</strong>: you burn extra calories just mobilizing larger energy throughput.</p>

<section id="tldr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>Being able to manage armies of AI, in the form of agents that can perform tasks autonomously on their own, will enable more leverage than ever before. When making choices about your career, this should always be top of mind. When in doubt, choose managing AI over managing people. Doing both is better, but one requires permission, while the other does not. Anyone can start managing AI today, so why haven’t you started already?</p>
</section>
<section id="ai-layoffs-have-started" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-layoffs-have-started">AI Layoffs Have Started</h3>
<p>Would you rather have your company spend 10x less or achieve 10x more? These are the two ends of the AI productivity spectrum. Right now senior leaders seem to be on the spend 10x less side, which is a bummer. The fastest way to grow earnings it seems is by cutting costs. They want to use AI tools that allow them to get the job done with less resources. This might make sense in a cash cow business with few competitors, but that’s rare and puts your business at risk of AI powered disruption. As Jeff Bezos used to say, “your margin is my opportunity”.</p>
<p>Spending 10x less is a known quantity, CFO’s can show how this impacts the bottom line and rewards shareholders. So of the two choices it’s the lower hanging fruit. Choosing to be 10x more productive with the same resources you have available is less certain. Will it lead to 10x sales? Maybe, but maybe not. This combined with economic uncertainty makes the choice easy for the CEO. They think they can make cuts AND achieve more, all powered by AI. Can you have your cake and eat it too? No one knows just yet.</p>
<p>We are starting to see less hiring in the tech space, even layoffs. When people leave teams, no one hires their back fill. That was the first wave of “silent layoffs”, now there are “loud layoffs” with thousands getting let go at major companies. This could be the start of a bigger trend. The classic tech era depictions on the HBO show “Silicon Valley” are now probably dead. The golden age of being a software developer are done. For decades, life was good if you had a rare set of skills that the world had an undying need for (writing code), but now AI can write the code. So the prickly coder who kept your companies core systems running is going from a necessary pain to one that can be replaced with AI powered tools. Specifically agentic AI systems that can do work on their own much like a person.</p>
<p>They say 2025 is the year of the AI agents, which you can also rephrase as the year of “non-human labor”. That is both terrifying and exciting. It’s only terrifying if you don’t change anything about your life, and very exciting if you know how to ride the wave. Let’s dig in.</p>
</section>
<section id="forms-of-leverage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forms-of-leverage">Forms of Leverage</h3>
<p>Naval Ravikant states there are three types of leverage.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Labor</strong>: people working for you</li>
<li><strong>Capital</strong>: using money to build things</li>
<li><strong>Permissionless</strong>: code and media that works while you sleep</li>
</ol>
<p>Labor is the oldest form of leverage with the greatest prestige, capital has been the most popular in recent decades, but permissionless leverage is the hot new thing that is getting turbocharged by AI.</p>
<p>Think about how companies got off in the ground in the last decade. It was common to go raise a bunch of money around an idea, then hire a bunch of people to go build the idea, then use what you built (often through code) to make a profit. That’s how the companies got the most amount of leverage in the least amount of time. Just like Tony Montana: first you get the money, then you get the labor, then you get the profit. It’s a model that works, but one that requires permission. People have to agree to give you money, or agree to work with you.</p>
<p>In recent years this model was disrupted partly by people who are experts at either code or media. Joe Rogan makes tens of millions every year through his podcast, which at most is probably operated by 3-5 people. Instagram sold to Facebook for one billion with only a dozen employees. These people did not need permission to start a podcast or go build a viral app. They were using forms of permissionless leverage.</p>
<p>Permissionless leverage is now becoming orders of magnitude more important with the power of AI. AI is removing the need for the first two forms of leverage, labor and capital. Before you needed money to hire a team, but now AI is your team in the form of agents. This means a team of one with a bootstrapped budget can have the same impact as large companies. But for this to happen you need agents AND agency.</p>
</section>
<section id="ai-agent-agency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-agent-agency">AI Agent = Agency</h3>
<p>When AI agents can start doing tasks similar to a human, what’s left for humans to do?</p>
<p>The most important skill to have in this new AI future is proactively taking action, also known as having a <a href="https://www.highagency.com/">high degree of agency</a>. Being a high agency person means you get stuff done. No one has to tell you what to do. You are proactively doing things.</p>
<p>Having access to AI agents that can do human work for a few bucks now allows you to do anything you want. The only problem now is taking the agency to go out and do it. Have an idea for a company? Now you can deploy agents to get it off the ground. They will quickly be able to do most things you’d hire a human for.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the product (app or service)</li>
<li>Track down potential customers to purchase the product, even sell to them</li>
<li>Answer support related questions from customers</li>
<li>Analyze the finances and recommend what market to expand into next</li>
</ul>
<p>People used to do these jobs, now agents are coming to do them. They will be used by people who have high agency, folks who go out and make a dent in the world instead of being told what to do. If your workday is driven by others telling you what to do instead of figuring out the most important thing to work on yourself. You might be in trouble. What’s stopping your boss from telling an AI agent to start doing that work instead of you? They give the same instructions to the agent, and it works 24/7. If you think about it from their point of view, it’s a no brainer. They’re going to choose the agent over a human. Having high agency means you think for yourself and proactively make choices that help your company. This might mean doing the opposite of what your boss asks you to do instead of being a yes man. If it helps the company in the end, you are called a maverick instead of insubordinate.</p>

<section id="future-career-paths" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-career-paths">Future Career Paths</h3>
<p>Career paths in a post AI agent world will never be the same again. Historically an ambitious career path might have looked like this.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Intern</strong>: You don’t know anything, but are there to learn and try not to slow the team down too much. Your contribution to the company is gaining knowledge about how work gets done, not in completing the work itself.</li>
<li><strong>Junior Employee</strong>: You are fresh out of school and ready to kick butt. You get the lowest level work that needs to get done, but doing it well grows your reputation for doing good work. Which allows you to work on more interesting things.</li>
<li><strong>Senior Employee</strong>: You have gotten so good at your job that now your boss wants you coming up with fresh ideas and running new initiatives. You now have more freedom to choose what you work on and how you get it done because you’ve proven to be reliable. People can count on you.</li>
<li><strong>People Manager</strong>: Congrats, you’ve kicked so much butt at the senior level that you are now in charge of your own team! Now you are really calling the shots and providing the direction for your employees to run towards. The individual contributor work you did is now out the window. People rely on you to make decisions, not to output work items.</li>
<li><strong>Senior Management</strong>: You’ve proved that you can run successful teams, and the top dogs think you have real potential so they move you up to the big leagues. Now you are looking over teams of teams, which is a whole other level of decision making and judgement. Now you are in charge of the long term strategic vision of the organization. Everything is long term and at a 30,000 ft view. The days of tiny details are over for you, you simply don’t have the time for it.</li>
<li><strong>C-Suite</strong>: The final stop on a lifelong career. The highest summit for which to have impact. Single decisions made by you now impact thousands of employees and even shape financial markets. Shareholders are relying on you to make the right decisions to impossible problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you were good at your job and had leadership potential, the next logical step was to rise to the next level. Normally the act of making progress leads to happiness in life. So making progress on this career ladder has the <em>potential</em> to make you happy. Do you see how each new level of the ladder gives you more access to labor and capital leverage? To rise to a new level of labor and capital leverage, someone at a higher level has to give the green light. You can only move one level at a time. Unless you start your own thing. No one goes from intern to a senior manager overnight at a large company.</p>
<p>What happens when AI agents come into the picture? How does this career ladder change? An army of labor is now accessible starting at the intern level, with the same level of access as the C-Suite. These agents don’t take breaks. They start off at a few bucks a month and scaling them might cost thousands, not tens of thousands like a human. <strong>I think corporate careers will start to turn into the career paths similar to musicians and athletes.</strong> Where the better the individual is, the greater the stage for them to do what they do best.</p>
<p>Let’s take Taylor Swift as an example. Taylor Swift came onto the scene over 15 years ago back when I was in high school. Since then what she does has not changed much. She still writes songs, she still performs in front of fans, and hopefully soon will stop making breakup songs once her and Travis Kelce settle down and make some rugrats. What has changed is the level at which she does it. Her most recent tour, the Eras Tour, made over a billion dollars within a year. That’s insane. At no point in her career did a music exec say “you’re so good at your job, we’re going to promote you to running the record label or managing the careers of other bands”. Instead she was given every resource imaginable to do what she does best at the next highest level. Over the past 15 years she has continued to level up. Doing bigger and better shows until now becoming the biggest artist in the world.</p>
<p>The same goes for athletes like my main man Patrick Mahomes. They start out as peewee football players like in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110364/">“The Little Giants”</a> and step by step the game gets more competitive, the crowds get bigger, and the money starts to roll in. Mahomes has been playing the same game his entire life, it’s just the stage he performs on is now the biggest in the world.</p>
<p>I believe people in the corporate world will do something similar. The best person in the world at something will now be able to do it for everyone else around the world. Similar to how everyone listens to Taylor Swift (if you say you don’t you’re lying) or watches Patrick Mahomes every Sunday (either hate watching or as a fan). So instead of being the best at your company and rising through the ranks to gain more leverage, I think now you can skip to the final level sooner and leverage an army of AI agents to help maximize what you do best not just for your company but for everyone in the world who would benefit from your expertise.</p>
<p>What I’m unsure about in this new age of infinite leverage is how the best in the world will do their work. Will they still be a part of large companies, or will they have their own company? For example let’s take the worlds best design expert, Jony Ive. He worked at Apple for 27 years. Then he started his own design firm called LoveFrom in 2019. Then created a new AI product company called io. Recently <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1925242282523103408">OpenAI acquired io</a> and now he will presumably work at OpenAI for the next few years. Jony is also a man in his late 50s, so maybe he’s still in the paradigm of the pre-AI work world even though he works on AI.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll dig deeper into the “gig economy”. Where someone might come to a company for a “tour of duty”, work on a project for a few years, then move on. The human will use AI agents to scale up a new project, then let the agents continue to manage it after they leave. Going from zero to one on something will take human effort and AI, but keeping a developed project afloat might only take AI. Sometimes I fantasize about “hacker guilds” or collectives of people that are hired as a group to go work on something for a set time. Instead of hiring a standard consulting firm or individual people, you hire a packaged group who already work well together and can kick butt from day one. Kind of like the military with special operations units. Hiring the seal team six equivalent of coders has 100x more leverage than hiring a hodgepodge of random big tech coders or Stanford grads.</p>
<p>Something I’ve learned over the years in corporate america is that companies do not love you, and will not miss you when you’re gone. People who work with you might miss you, but everything eventually comes to an end in all aspects of life. You are not indispensable and you probably can be replaced. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be loyal to one company for many years. It just means not to attach too much of your identity to any one thing in life.</p>
<p>We’ll have to see how this plays out in the next few years. What I know for certain is that personal branding is going to rise to a whole new level. As AI agents give more people leverage, their impact can rise faster than it can within a single company. So having a strong personal brand amplified by superintelligence will be essential. If you aren’t working on your brand today, start now. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the next best time is today.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>We are quickly coming into a new world of infinite leverage. One where the only bottleneck is getting off your butt and taking action. Successful careers will no longer be measured in how much money you raised or how many people work for you, but instead in how much value you provide the world. Being able to work with and even directly manage people will still be important, but it will not be the biggest force multiplier anymore. Being able to leverage and manage AI will. Get started now.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it does</strong>: Acts like a hormone, flipping 200+ genes for immune function, mood, and bone strength.</li>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: Indoor living leaves ~40 % of adults short.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Supplement 2 000–4 000 IU of vitamin D₃ daily; pair with vitamin K₂ (≈ 100 µg) so calcium goes to bones, not arteries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Omega 3</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why care</strong>: Higher blood omega-3 can add years to life, cut triglycerides, and calm inflammation.</li>
<li><strong>Targets</strong>: 1000–2000 mg EPA + DHA daily from fatty fish or purified fish-/algal-oil capsules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Magnesium</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roles</strong>: Needed for 300+ enzymes, ATP energy, nerve balance, vitamin D activation.</li>
<li><strong>Shortfall</strong>: Nearly half the population under-consumes it.</li>
<li><strong>Dose</strong>: 200–400 mg nightly (glycinate, citrate, or malate). Bonus: deeper sleep, fewer cramps, steadier blood pressure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Triage Theory</strong>
<ul>
<li>Minor shortages get “triaged” to urgent tasks (e.g., keeping blood clotting) while long-term maintenance (DNA repair, artery upkeep) is skipped. You feel fine today but sow seeds of cancer, heart disease, or dementia decades later.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: keep every micronutrient in the green zone, not just “barely adequate.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Multivitamins</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over 90 % of people miss at least one essential nutrient from food. A quality multivitamin/mineral fills common gaps safely and cheaply. Urine color doesn’t equal wasted value; it simply shows water-soluble B-vitamins passing through.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personalized Nutrition</strong>
<ul>
<li>Variants in genes like MTHFR (folate), vitamin D receptors, or magnesium transporters can raise your optimal intake. Simple DNA tests plus blood work reveal whether you need more of certain B-vitamins, choline, or others. One-size-fits-all dosing belongs in the last century.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nutrient Synergy</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Magnesium + Vitamin D</strong>: Mg activates D; D can’t perform without it.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin D + K2</strong>: D boosts calcium absorption; K2 directs calcium to bones.</li>
<li><strong>Food First</strong>: Whole foods pack these combos naturally—e.g., salmon (D + omega-3s), leafy greens (Mg + K), bell peppers (vitamin C aids iron absorption).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Phytochemicals</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sulforaphane</strong>: From broccoli sprouts; switches on Nrf2, your cell-cleanup master switch. Two servings of sprouts or a 10–20 mg extract a few times weekly can boost detox enzymes and antioxidant defenses.</li>
<li><strong>Anthocyanins</strong>: Blue/purple pigments in berries improve brain blood flow and memory; aim for a daily cup of mixed berries or a concentrated powder.</li>
<li><strong>Rule of Thumb</strong>: “Eat the rainbow” = free daily antioxidant therapy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Processed Foods</strong>
<ul>
<li>Factory foods hijack appetite, spike blood sugar, and displace nutrients. In controlled trials people eat about 500 extra calories a day and gain weight on an ultra-processed diet even when meals are calorie-matched. Swap packaged snacks, sodas, and fast-food for whole-food versions; your waistline, microbiome, and inflammation markers will thank you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>VO2 Max</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cardiorespiratory fitness trumps almost every other risk factor. Moving from “poor” to “average” fitness slashes mortality risk as much as quitting smoking. Aim for at least:
<ul>
<li>150 min/week moderate cardio (or 75 min vigorous), plus</li>
<li>2–3 strength sessions to preserve muscle and bone. Mix in interval training or hiking hills to nudge VO₂ max higher—adaptation happens at every age.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<p>After you train a model and create a forecast, you can either blindly trust that future forecast or figure out much you should trust it based on some evaluation. NASA has a saying, “in god we trust, all others bring data”. If you create a forecast with no accompanying data around it to build trust in that forecast, no one will want to use it. That’s why we need to implement model evaluation. Here are the foundational concepts we’ll cover in this chapter.</p>

<p><em>The example monthly data used in this series <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-10-02-ts-fundamentals-whats-a-time-series/example_ts_data.csv">can be found here.</a> You can also find the <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/2025-05-12-ts-fundamentals-univariate-benchmarks.ipynb">python code used in this post here.</a></em></p>
<section id="what-are-benchmark-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-benchmark-models">What Are Benchmark Models?</h3>
<p>A benchmark model is a simple model that can be used as a forecast or to compare its forecast outputs against another model that is more complex. These models don’t incorporate statistical or machine learning methods, instead they use standard formulas to produce forecasts.</p>
</section>
<section id="type-of-benchmark-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="type-of-benchmark-models">Type of Benchmark Models</h3>
<p>There are three main benchmarking models we’ll discuss today. They are many other models/methods that can be used as benchmarks but these are the three most common.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean Forecast</strong>
<ul>
<li>Simple average of the last few periods of the time series. You could take the average of the last 12 months and use that as the forecast, the time period you use to create the average is up to you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Naive Forecast</strong>
<ul>
<li>Take the last value in the time series and use that as the forecast. This is the simplest forecast method possible, that’s why it’s called “naive”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Seasonal Naive Forecast</strong>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the naive method, but you take the value from the previous season and use that as the forecast. For example with monthly data, next months forecast could be the value for that month in the previous year.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lets-create-a-forecast" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-create-a-forecast">Let’s Create a Forecast</h3>
<p>Let’s take one of our example time series and create these benchmark forecasts.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-05-12-ts-fundamentals-univariate-benchmarks/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Looks like our future forecast for each model doesn’t look good. No trends were captured, same goes for seasonality outside of the seasonal naive model. These models produced future forecasts, just none that we want to use for our final forecast.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-use-them" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-use-them">How to Use Them</h3>
<p>Benchmark models can be ran first when starting a new forecast project to establish a simple baseline of accuracy for more advanced models to beat. You might build a fancy neural network model from scratch, but it may have the same accuracy as a dumb seasonal naive model. So starting with benchmark models first is always a good idea. <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-05-03-time-series-simple-models/">Simple models are better models</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-benchmark-methods" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-benchmark-methods">Other Benchmark Methods</h3>
<p>Today we just covered the three most common benchmark models, but there are countless others you can use too. Here are a few more to pique your interest.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Mean Forecast Methods</strong>
<ul>
<li>Instead of averaging over the past year, you can average over the past quarter, the entire time series, or any other significant period.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Random Walk with Drift</strong>
<ul>
<li>A variation of the naive method allows the forecasts to change over time. The amount of change, called drift, is the average change seen in the historical data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Seasonal Mean Forecast</strong>
<ul>
<li>Similar to previously discussed mean forecast methods, but this time you are averaging the values within the same season. For example, for monthly data you might take the average value of the previous years for the month of December to use that to create a future forecast for December.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growth Rate Forecast Methods</strong>
<ul>
<li>If the time series lacks seasonality, you can apply a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) or similar average growth over “xyz” time periods and apply that to create a future forecast.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Benchmark models might seem overly simplistic, but their real value lies in their role as the first step of your forecasting process. Establishing a simple, transparent baseline makes it easier to measure and justify the incremental gains from more sophisticated methods. Remember, complexity does not always equal accuracy; sometimes the simplest models offer the clearest insights. When in doubt, start simple and build complexity as needed.</p>

  <title>Univariate Models: Exponential Smoothing</title>

<section id="what-does-exponential-smoothing-mean" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-exponential-smoothing-mean">What Does Exponential Smoothing Mean?</h3>
<p>Exponential smoothing is a family of forecasting methods that smooth out short-term fluctuations in data to reveal underlying trends or patterns. The core idea is to give more weight to recent observations and less weight to older data, which produces a “smoothed” time series with reduced noise​. This makes it easier to spot patterns and predict future values.</p>
<p>It’s also referred to as ETS, which stands for error, trend, and seasonality. These three components are at the heart of the most advanced exponential smoothing methods. Sometimes you might also hear them be called “state space” models, since they are modeling out different states like trend and seasonality separately.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error (E)</strong>: The unpredictable or random fluctuations (noise) around your forecast.</li>
<li><strong>Trend (T)</strong>: A longer-term movement (upward or downward) observed in your data.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonality (S)</strong>: Regular patterns or cycles occurring within a known fixed period (e.g., yearly, monthly, weekly).</li>
</ul>
<p>Another component of these models is something called the level. Think of the level (sometimes called the baseline) as the smoothed estimate of ‘where we are right now’, before any trend pushes us up or seasonality ripples us up and down. Here’s how they are put together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseline right now → <strong>level</strong></li>
<li>How the baseline is moving → <strong>trend</strong></li>
<li>Repeating wiggles → <strong>seasonality</strong></li>
<li>Random noise around all that → <strong>error</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="types-of-exponential-smoothing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-exponential-smoothing">Types of Exponential Smoothing</h3>
<p>Exponential smoothing isn’t a single technique but a family that includes simple (single) smoothing, double smoothing, and triple smoothing. Each one builds on the previous to handle more complex patterns in the data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Exponential Smoothing</strong>: Used for data with no clear trend or seasonality.</li>
<li><strong>Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt’s Linear Trend)</strong>: Used for data with a trend (increasing or decreasing sales over time).</li>
<li><strong>Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)</strong>: Used for data with both trend and seasonality (recurring seasonal patterns, such as higher sales every holiday season).</li>
</ul>
<p>Most time series we deal with in the business have both trend and seasonality, so we’ll focus mostly on triple exponential smoothing going forward.</p>
</section>
<section id="modeling-error-trend-and-seasonality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modeling-error-trend-and-seasonality">Modeling Error, Trend, and Seasonality</h3>
<p>Exponential smoothing models—especially the Holt-Winters model—perform decomposition implicitly. They don’t require explicit pre-decomposition of your data (unlike <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-11-06-ts-fundamentals-decomposition/">STL decomposition</a>, which explicitly separates the time series into distinct parts). Instead, they simultaneously estimate these components using exponential smoothing equations.</p>
</section>
<section id="additive-vs-multiplicative" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additive-vs-multiplicative">Additive vs Multiplicative</h3>
<p>When using exponential smoothing (ETS) models, you can model patterns like trends and seasonality in two ways: additive or multiplicative.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additive</strong> means seasonal and trend effects are constant amounts added or subtracted each period—think of a retailer whose sales always increase by exactly 500 units every holiday season.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplicative</strong> means these effects are percentage-based, scaling up or down with your baseline. Like a business whose holiday sales consistently spike by 20%, making seasonal swings grow in magnitude as the company expands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the correct method ensures your forecasts closely match your real-world sales patterns, greatly improving forecast accuracy and business decisions.</p>
</section>
<section id="putting-it-all-together" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h3>
<p>Exponential smoothing models produce future forecasts by systematically updating estimates of error, trend, and seasonality based on recent data points. Here’s how the forecasting process typically unfolds.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Initialization</strong>: Begin with historical data to establish initial estimates for the level (baseline), trend, and seasonal components.</li>
<li><strong>Updating Components</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: Adjusted each period based on recent observations, blending new data with previous estimates to capture the underlying baseline.</li>
<li><strong>Trend</strong>: Updated by measuring changes in the baseline from period to period, capturing increases or decreases over time.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonality</strong>: Regularly adjusted based on the latest observations relative to the baseline, ensuring that recurring seasonal patterns remain accurate.</li>
<li><strong>Forecasting Future Values</strong>: Once the model updates these components, it combines them to project forward. In an additive model, the forecast is calculated by summing the baseline, trend, and seasonal effects. In a multiplicative model, these components are multiplied, scaling the forecast proportionally.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>By continuously integrating new data, exponential smoothing models dynamically refine forecasts, making them highly responsive and reliable for various business needs, from inventory management to budgeting and planning.</p>
</section>
<section id="lets-train-a-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-train-a-model">Let’s Train A Model</h3>
<p>Let’s take one of our example time series and create an ETS forecast 12 months into the future and see how things look.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-04-30-ts-fundamentals-univariate-ets/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Nice! The ets model was able to capture the historical trend and seasonality and carry it forward into the future. We’re also able to see two other things in the chart.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hypothetical forecasts of the training data. These are often referred to as fitted values and can be used to calculate residuals, which are simply the difference between the forecast and actual value. Historically the ets model performed very well, closely matching the actual revenue values from month to month.</li>
<li>A 95% prediction interval. This represents with 95% certainty the upper and lower ranges where the model thinks the future value will land between. The tighter this interval the more certain the model is in its prediction. We will dig deep into prediction intervals in more detail in a later post.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="reversal" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reversal">Reversal</h3>
<p>ETS models are powerful, but not in every circumstance. Here are situations where they might struggle to produce quality forecasts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big, sudden shifts (a&nbsp;merger, a COVID‑style shock, a new pricing policy)</strong>
<ul>
<li>ETS learns slowly, so its forecasts keep reaching back to “the old world” and miss the new level or trend.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stop‑and‑go, “lumpy” demand (lots of zeros, random spikes)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Exponential averaging smooths the spikes away, underforecasting the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>More than one seasonality marching at once (hour‑of‑day&nbsp;+&nbsp;day‑of‑week&nbsp;+&nbsp;holidays)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Classic Holt‑Winters can juggle only one seasonal cycle, so leftover patterns keep showing up in the residuals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>When outside forces rule the game (promotions, ad spend, macro shocks)</strong>
<ul>
<li>ETS is univariate, if your forecast errors line up with random one time events, you’re in the wrong model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tiny history (less than two full seasons of data)</strong>
<ul>
<li>With so little to learn from, ETS guesses at seasonality and wobbles all over the place.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>ETS shines when your data marches to one clear seasonal drumbeat and drifts in a steady direction. Feed it that steady history and it returns forecasts that are fast, transparent, and business-ready. Know its blind spots (multiple calendars, lumpy demand, sudden upheavals) and you’ll know exactly when to trust it and when to reach for heavier gear.</p>

  <title>We Learn Best By Doing, Not By Studying</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-04-19-projects/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Have you ever wanted to grow your career at work? What did you do? Most likely you took on a tough new project that would force you to learn new skills to get the work done. The project put healthy pressure on you to gain those skills, all because your manager was counting on you to get it done. A good project builds on existing knowledge, but also forces you to grow in areas that make you better. It’s that sweet spot of flow. Not too easy, but also not too hard.</p>
<p><strong>If that’s how adults learn in the real world, why don’t kids do the same thing?</strong></p>
<p>How you learn in school is completely different than how you learn on the job.</p>
<p>School Based Learning</p>
<ul>
<li>Read books</li>
<li>Classroom lectures in groups of 20+ people</li>
<li>Take tests to prove knowledge</li>
<li>Knowledge is siloed, you learn math then science then social studies separately</li>
<li>Everything is paced at a specific speed</li>
<li>No control over what you want to learn, if you hate your classes you just need to suck it up and power through them</li>
</ul>
<p>Work Based Learning</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn 1n1 from managers, mentors, and teammates</li>
<li>Finish projects to prove knowledge</li>
<li>Projects combine many skills into one problem to work on</li>
<li>No pacing, advance your career as fast or as slow as you desire</li>
<li>Choose your own adventure for what you want to learn, if you hate your job you get a new job</li>
</ul>
<p>Kids are on these artificial train tracks for 22 years of their life, then all of a sudden they are ripped off and thrown into the wild west once they start their careers. What if they started work based learning sooner? Maybe even from day one?</p>
<p>The hardest part of work based, aka project based, learning is scaling the 1n1 aspect. This is where AI comes in. AI is quickly becoming the smartest thing in the world, which means it can be the best teacher in the world at anything. Kids in rural India will have the same access to AI as trust fund kids in New York City. It will be the great equalizer in education.</p>
<p>What if kids were allowed to learn what they wanted, when they wanted? Project based learning can truly be a choose your own adventure while still covering most of the basics of what every kid needs to know. A kid could probably learn calculus before the age of 12 if they truly loved math. Why slow them down with traditional pacing of going from first grade, to second grade, to third grade, etc. This becomes supercharged with AI.</p>
<p>Large language models like GPT-4o from OpenAI can tailor education to each student based on what they like doing the most. If a kid loves F1 racing then imagine learning about the chemistry of racing fuel, the physics of aerodynamic cars, even to how racers build their personal brands to reach millions. That kid will learn 100x faster doing that than reading out of a standard textbook and taking a standard test.</p>
<p><strong>We learn best by doing, not by studying.</strong></p>
<p>In a new AI world, it doesn’t make sense to study flashcards when the smartest thing in the world are AI models that everyone will eventually access for free. Being the best at remembering stuff is not a competitive advantage in a new AI first world. Instead AI should be teaching kids through projects that they’re the most interested in. People impact the world by doing things they love, so why not have kids build that sense of agency around doing interesting things while learning along the way as early as possible?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">Sam Altman’s Productivity Tips</a>
<ul>
<li>The best way to be productive is knowing what to work on. The right thing done at the wrong time yields zero results. So make sure you really think through the work you choose to do each day.</li>
<li>Sam ruthlessly prioritizes. Writing his priorities on paper each day.</li>
<li>He has long blocks of uninterrupted time in his schedule, even as the CEO of OpenAI. If he can do it, we all can.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/cofertility-lets-women-freeze-their-eggs-for-free-through-its-donor-matching-program/">New Company Allows You To Freeze Your Eggs For Free</a>
<ul>
<li>Cofertility’s radical model for women: Freeze your eggs for free by donating half of them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://ryanholiday.net/these-are-leadership-ideas-i-try-to-apply-every-day/">Ryan Holiday’s Leadership Philosophy</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a great list of leadership lessons and approaches to being a good boss. Here are a few that stood out to me.
<ul>
<li>Sense of urgency: You can either get that project done next week or next month. Both ways will produce the same result.</li>
<li>Don’t touch paper twice: You can only keep so many “open tabs” in your head. Make decisions and work on things only once, don’t keep them all running in your head constantly.<br>
</li>
<li>I’m leaving this with you: Bring problems for employees to solve and get the hell out of the way. Don’t let them bring the monkey and place it on your back again.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.approachwithalacrity.com/101-things-for-my-past-self/">101 Things I’d Tell Myself From 10 Years Ago</a>
<ul>
<li>Giving advice to our past self is a great exercise, even better if we pretend to be in the future and give advice to our current self. Here are a few that stood out to me.
<ul>
<li>Write more on the internet to increase your luck surface area.</li>
<li>Don’t fall in love with something that can’t love you back. Companies do not spend a week crying when you break up with them.</li>
<li>Your inbound opportunities are worse than the ones you carefully select and nurture over time. This is true both if you are an engineer looking for a job and if you are a 19-year-old girl looking for someone to date.</li>
<li>You should aim to produce things at about a 1:10 ratio to how much you consume them. This is true of food, videos, internet comments and parties.</li>
<li>Consider deleting as often as you consider adding. This holds true for code, furniture and obligations.</li>

  <title>Univariate Models: ARIMA</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-04-10-ts-fundamentals-univariate-arima/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-24-ts-fundamentals-univariate-models/">univariate models chapter</a> within a larger learning series around time series forecasting fundamentals. <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-09-25-ts-fundamentals/">Check out the main learning path</a> to see other posts in the series.</em></p>
<p><em>The example monthly data used in this series <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-10-02-ts-fundamentals-whats-a-time-series/example_ts_data.csv">can be found here.</a> You can also find the <a href="https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/2025-04-10-ts-fundamentals-univariate-arima.ipynb">python code used in this post here.</a></em></p>
<section id="lets-break-arima-down" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-break-arima-down">Let’s Break ARIMA Down</h3>
<p>Arima stands for autoregressive integrated moving average. That sounds like a mouthful so we’ll take it step by step on how each component works.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR (AutoRegressive)</strong>: The current value depends on past values of itself</li>
<li><strong>I (Integrated)</strong>: Difference the data to make it <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/">stationary</a></li>
<li><strong>MA (Moving Average)</strong>: The current value depends on past prediction errors</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="putting-it-all-together" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it All Together</h3>
<p>Here’s what happens when an arima model is trained.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Integrated</strong>: Difference the data d times to remove trend or seasonality, making the series stationary. This is necessary so that the AR and MA components can model the structure reliably.</li>
<li><strong>Autoregressive</strong>: Model the differenced series as a linear combination of its own lagged values. This captures momentum or persistence in the time series aka how past values influence future ones.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Average</strong>: Model the current value as a function of past forecast errors. These errors are not directly observed, so the model estimates them recursively during training, learning how random shocks in the past influence the present.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: The AR and MA parts are fitted together by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data, given the model structure. This involves recursively computing residuals and using numerical optimization to find the best parameters.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create future forecasts, we’d take the trained model and do the following.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Autoregressive</strong>: Predict differenced values using past observations (or predictions) via the AR terms.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Average</strong>: Refine predictions using known or assumed residual errors from past forecasts.</li>
<li><strong>Recursive Forecasting</strong>: Forecast multiple steps ahead by reusing your own predictions as inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated</strong>: Reverse the differencing operation to return the forecast to the original scale.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, now we know how arima works at a high level and how it can be used to create future forecasts. But there’s one major thing missing. The arima process we went through is for non-seasonal data. If our data has seasonality, we need to fit a seasonal arima model. It’s very similar to the plain vanilla arima model, but has a separate process added to handle seasonal differencing and seasonal lags. For example instead of comparing sales of last month to sales in this month, a seasonal approach would compare sales of 12 months ago with sales in this month. It’s kind of like stacking another arima on top of arima, but operating at a seasonal level.</p>
</section>
<section id="lets-train-a-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-train-a-model">Let’s Train a Model</h3>
<p>Let’s take one of our example time series and create an arima forecast 12 months into the future and see how things look.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-04-10-ts-fundamentals-univariate-arima/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Looks pretty good! The arima model was able to capture the historical trend and seasonality and carry it forward into the future. We’re also able to see two other things in the chart.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hypothetical forecasts of the training data. These are often referred to as fitted values and can be used to calculate residuals, which are simply the difference between the forecast and actual value. Historically the arima model performed very well, closely matching the actual revenue values from month to month.</li>
<li>A 95% prediction interval. This represents with 95% certainty the upper and lower ranges where the model thinks the future value will land between. The tighter this interval the more certain the model is in its prediction. We will dig deep into prediction intervals in more detail in a later post.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="reversal" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reversal">Reversal</h3>
<p>Arima is a cornerstone of every forecasters toolbox, but it does come with some drawbacks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Assumes linearity of the data</strong> since it learns linear patters in previous data, which may not work well if the data has non-linear patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Not the best at long term forecasting.</strong> Sometimes an arima model can converge to the mean of the data or a constant value over a long enough forecast horizon. This removes any kind of trend or seasonality the data might possess.</li>
<li><strong>Finding the right parameters</strong> (number of differencing, AR and MA values) is not always optimal</li>

<p>Arima is one of the most foundational models in time series forecasting. Not because it’s perfect, but because it’s interpretable, fast to train, and often surprisingly effective for short-term, univariate forecasting problems. It gives us a solid mental model for thinking about time series structure: trends, momentum, and noise.</p>
<p>That said, arima models come with limitations. They assume linearity, can struggle with longer horizons, and require a stationary signal to be effective. One particularly important limitation is that arima only looks at the past values of the target variable. It doesn’t account for external factors like promotions, weather, or economic indicators unless you explicitly modify the model to include them.</p>
<p>We’ll look at ways to incorporate external regressors into time series models soon, but understanding how arima works in isolation is the right starting point. If you can reason through the arima process step by step, you’re building a strong foundation for more powerful forecasting techniques down the road.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</p>
<p>— <em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have two options, choose wisely.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You are given a million dollars a day for the rest of your life</li>
<li>You are given a penny today, but each subsequent day the value doubles</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one would you pick? Most humans understand linear returns, but not everyone understands compound returns. For option one, you’d have $365 million dollars at the end of a year. Sounds pretty good! What about option two?</p>
<ul>
<li>After 7 days: $1.27, basically nothing</li>
<li>After 30 days: $10 million, wow that’s great but still trailing option one</li>
<li>After 36 days: $365 million, same as option one</li>
<li>After 365 days: 7.52 × 10¹⁰⁷, basically more money than the world has ever seen</li>
</ul>
<p>Option two doesn’t start out sexy but in the end creates untold return. That’s how most things operate in life. Something starts off slow, barely trickles along for a while, then all of a sudden get’s escape velocity and rockets upwards. This is often called “hockey stick” growth, because it looks just like a hock stick with a flat line turning into one that shoots straight up.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-greatest-returns-always-come-at-the-end">The Greatest Returns Always Come At The End</h3>
<p>For those who do understand the power of compounding, or do now after reading this, their mindset around it is most likely tied to financial markets. Few think about how compounding can be applied to so many other aspects of life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Career</li>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had $100 to invest today, would you invest it in the S&amp;P 500 index, containing the largest american companies, or invest it in yourself? I think most people understand the earlier you invest in the financial markets, the greater the return. But few understand this for investing in yourself.</p>
<p>The average american lifespan is 79 years. A $100 invested in the S&amp;P 500 index 79 years ago would today be valued at $473,355. That sounds crazy right! But it’s just the math of compounding. That equals around a 11.4% annual growth of the investment each year (compound annual growth rate). That CAGR of 11.4% doesn’t sound as sexy as a 473,254% total return over the period. Because the time horizon was so long, a yearly return of 11.4% can really start to add up over the years.</p>
<p>How much of the ending amount of ~$500k was created in the first few years compared to the last few years? This is where the <em>math</em> really gets <em>mathing</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First 64 years (1947-2010): creates 20% of end investment gain</li>
<li>Last 15 years (2011-2025): creates 80% of end investment gain</li>
</ul>
<p>This proves that showing up every day and sticking it out for the long haul can create the most investment return. If you are already investing in the stock market and are sitting back to let compounding do its magic, good for you. But are you compounding other parts of your life?</p>
<p><strong>My main point in this post is that it’s easier to compound yourself faster than the S&amp;P 500</strong> return of 11.4% per year. You are capable of doubling the value in yourself each year, which brings you closer to the untold returns of option two of our thought experiment.</p>

<section id="compounding-life-slows-down-as-we-age" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compounding-life-slows-down-as-we-age">Compounding Life Slows Down As We Age</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Many people die at twenty-five and aren’t buried until they are seventy-five.”</p>
<p>— <em>Benjamin Franklin</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first quarter of life is spent in personal compounding mode. You start out at zero when born, then slowly rise through the ranks. Each year what you learn not just doubles but may even 10x on a month to month basis. Going from your first word, to speaking full sentences, to writing and reading is a true hockey stick growth pattern. Same goes for math, emotions, and understanding others in the world around you.</p>
<p>After you finish school (undergraduate college) and get a few years of work under your belt I think our level of compounding falls off. You are still growing as a person, but not as fast as you once did. Instead of measuring changes in 1-4 year increments you now compare yourself through different decades in your life. You go from saying “back in college” (four year span) to “back in my 20s” or “in my 30s” (10 year span). This level of compounding is now more closely tied to what you can get out of the S&amp;P 500. But I think life doesn’t have to be this way. We can continue to compound ourselves through learning and personal growth at a fast clip forever. The perfect example is Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. They have been kicking ass well into their 90s, with most of their success coming after turning 60.</p>
<p>Morgan Housel in his book <a href="https://a.co/d/iKWJfEd">The Psychology of Money</a> tells a powerful story about a man named Ronald Read. Ronald was a janitor and gas station attendant for his entire life. When he died at 92, he had over $8,000,000 in stock investments that were quietly compounding for decades. This money was donated to hospitals and libraries in his town, making him a celebrity after his death.</p>
<p>After reading a story like Ronald’s you may have one of the following thoughts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wow that guy did investing right, this proves that anyone can save money to build wealth.</li>
<li>Why didn’t he use some of that money to live a better life than being a janitor, like vacationing in europe every summer?</li>
<li><strong>Why was he a janitor his entire life!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ronald was able to compound his investments, but not his career. Who knows, maybe he crushed it at every aspect of life and just enjoyed being a janitor. All power to him. But it’s just surprising to see a man so good at compounding money not doing the same to compound himself in other areas of life.</p>
<p>With the exception of people like Ronald, most people who are deemed successful by society can continue to compound their career or investments at a fast rate through the first half of life, but often at the expense of other areas like health and relationships. We’ve all seen tech founders who are kings of the world, but are obese or divorced. They have compounded two aspects of their life, money and career, but not other important areas that make life worth living.</p>
<p>Once people hit their 60s, almost everything in their life stops compounding for good, and starts compounding in a bad way. Their health starts to decline, they have less friends, they see their children/family less, and they quit their career altogether aka retire. Things decline for 20-30 years until they die. Wow that sucks, and I don’t think it has to be this way.</p>
<p>Advancements in technology and medicine will allow us to start living past 100 with ease, this creates more runway for us to compound ourselves. Why retire at 65 if you still feel like your in your 30s with limitless energy? If the power of compounding comes in the last few years, shouldn’t we ramping up our lives after 60 than slowing them down?</p>
<p>We all need to think more about how we can continue to compound ourselves in every aspect in life, not just money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Money</li>
<li>Career</li>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="compounding-intelligence-and-health" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compounding-intelligence-and-health">Compounding Intelligence and Health</h3>
<p><strong>Most people seem to be pretty bad at compounding intelligence and health once they hit 30. Some say 30 is their peak for health, which if you want to live past 100 that’s like saying you peaked in high school.</strong> There is so much more life to live. Every one needs to continue learning and applying that knowledge (aka intelligence) to make their life better. Same goes for health. It’s much easier to be healthy at 80 if your were healthy at 60, and especially if you were healthy at 30. Small things compound remember?</p>
<p>Compounding intelligence and health often takes money. Buying books, measuring your blood, or talking to experts all cost money. Some people would rather buy a porsche than a red light bed, but only one of those is going to change your cellular biology for the better. What if taking $500 in supplements each month allows you to feel 50% better and get 20% more work done in your job? Maybe that allows you to get a promotion 50% faster or have 20% more quality time with your kids? Is it a better investment than putting that $500 in the S&amp;P 500? Maybe…it depends how fast you can make that money compound. Most things we buy (cars, clothes, Netflix) have no compound returns. Possibly negative returns. So make sure you spend your money on the right things.</p>
</section>
<section id="compounding-relationships" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compounding-relationships">Compounding Relationships</h3>
<p>Relationships also take a hit after 30. People get married, have kids, and continue to climb the corporate ladder. That removes all available time to invest into the friends and family around you. I call this the <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-06-28-life-circles/">“inner circles of life”</a>, where each stage in life your priorities change. Even as your priorities change, having quality relationships that compound over decades is a good investment. <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/">Quality relationships</a> literally make you live longer. <strong>Keep those childhood friendships going. They’re like a garden, you need to tend to them every year or they will starve and die.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="compounding-failure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compounding-failure">Compounding = Failure</h3>
<p>Ok, maybe by now you are on board the “let’s compound everything for life” train, but how? <strong>Failure is the best way to compound yourself.</strong> Malcolm Gladwell says it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. But others like Naval Ravikant say that it actually takes 10,000 iterations. Not repetitions, but instead trying to do something, failing, and iterating in the next attempt. That’s how children learn everything, but as we get older we shy away from being wrong. Being wrong in public is our worst nightmare, but often that’s the best way to improve.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Compounding isn’t just math, it’s a life strategy. Unlike traditional investments, investing in yourself offers infinite returns. Simple, consistent actions like reading, exercising, or nurturing relationships quietly compound into massive growth over time.</p>
<p>The real power of compounding lies in its subtlety. It starts small, barely noticeable, but steadily builds momentum until you’re amazed by the results. Remember, life isn’t about financial gain alone. It’s about intentionally growing every aspect (career, intelligence, health, relationships) to shape a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>Picture yourself at 100, still sharp, healthy, loved, wealthy, and living your greatest adventure yet because you never stopped compounding yourself. That reality starts today.</p>

  <title>March Learnings</title>
  <dc:creator>Mike Tokic</dc:creator>
  <link>https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-04-04-march-learnings/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I love reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, you name it. Anything learning related is my jam. But I realized that if I don’t take notes on what I’m learning, I will probably forget everything. Now when I hear something interesting, I write it down in an Apple note for that month. Below are some of the learnings I jotted down in March, summarized by ChatGPT with additional context added by their new deep research feature. I hope you find them as interesting as I did.</p>
<section id="health-longevity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="health-longevity">Health &amp; Longevity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Alzheimer’s as “Type 3 Diabetes”</strong><br>
Some researchers now refer to Alzheimer’s disease as “type 3 diabetes” because it’s strongly linked to insulin resistance in the brain.<sup>1</sup> In essence, neurons become less responsive to insulin, which impairs memory and cognition—underscoring the huge role that blood sugar control plays in brain health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fasting—It Depends on Your A1C</strong><br>
Fasting isn’t one-size-fits-all. If your hemoglobin A1C (a marker of blood sugar) is already low (around 4.8–5.2%), aggressive fasting might stress your hormones (e.g., spiking cortisol and upsetting thyroid or sex hormones).<sup>2</sup>. But if your A1C is high, intermittent fasting can help—research shows it can reverse insulin resistance and even lower A1C levels.<sup>3</sup> The takeaway: people with high blood sugar may benefit from fasting, while those with normal/low A1C should be cautious not to overdo it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent Sleep &gt; Long Sleep</strong><br>
When it comes to sleep, consistency is king. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day has a bigger impact on health than the total hours of sleep.<sup>4</sup> In fact, maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule can add years to your life by aligning with your circadian rhythm.<sup>5</sup> It’s better to get, say, 6.5 hours every night reliably than 8 hours one night and 5 the next.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitochondria: The Root of Many Diseases</strong><br>
Many diseases boil down to broken mitochondria. These tiny energy producers, if they fail in a given tissue, cause that organ to struggle. Some experts say “mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the etiology of most common complex diseases, as well as aging”.<sup>6</sup> So protect your mitochondria through good nutrition, exercise, and reduced toxin exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autoimmune Diseases Hit Women Hardest</strong><br>
~80% of autoimmune disease patients are female.<sup>7</sup> This striking ratio could stem from hormones, genetic factors (many immune-related genes on the X chromosome), and even microbiome differences. Either way, it’s a reminder that women face unique health vulnerabilities and need specialized research and care.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Longevity “Power Rankings”</strong><br>
The most impactful factors for living longer (often into your 90s):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Don’t smoke:</strong> Smoking knocks ~10 years off your life.<sup>8</sup></li>
<li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> At least 30 minutes of moderate activity daily. This can add years to your lifespan.<sup>9</sup></li>
<li><strong>Mediterranean diet:</strong> Linked to ~20–25% lower all-cause mortality.<sup>10</sup></li>
<li><strong>BMI of ~18–22:</strong> Excess fat is risky. The average American man has 28% body fat.<sup>11</sup></li>
<li><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> Heavy drinking raises risk of cancers and liver disease.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize sleep:</strong> ~7–8 hours a night is linked to better longevity.<sup>12</sup></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Navy Dolphins Live 3x Longer</strong><br>
Dolphins in the wild typically live ~20 years, but those raised by the U.S. Navy reach 40–60 years.<sup>13</sup> It’s a striking example of how consistent nutrition, healthcare, and a protected environment can dramatically extend longevity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Humans Are Fatter Than Pigs</strong><br>
The average American man’s body fat is ~28%<sup>14</sup>, while modern farm pigs are ~16–20%. This reveals just how normalized overweight conditions have become in humans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Half-Life of Medical Knowledge</strong><br>
The “half-life” of med school training is ~18–24 months.<sup>15</sup> That means half of what doctors learn becomes outdated within two years. Rapid research advances demand ongoing education.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="human-psychology-behavior" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="human-psychology-behavior">Human Psychology &amp; Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>“Language Sets Your Limits”</strong><br>
Echoing Ludwig Wittgenstein: if you lack words for certain ideas or emotions, you struggle to conceptualize them.<sup>16</sup> Expanding your vocabulary or learning new languages can literally expand the boundaries of your world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pretty Privilege &amp; Athlete Privilege</strong><br>
Society tends to give attractive women and elite male athletes a pass on bad behavior. Studies show attractive people receive more lenient treatment<sup>17</sup>, and star athletes often face fewer consequences.<sup>18</sup> Recognizing this bias can be the first step to correcting it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mormon Influencers &amp; Journaling Culture</strong><br>
The Church of Latter-day Saints encourages regular journaling and sharing of personal insights.<sup>19</sup> This cultural norm produces individuals who are comfortable with transparent storytelling—perfectly suited to be bloggers/vloggers, which may explain their disproportionate presence online.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two Sides of a Pancake</strong><br>
An old saying: “No matter how thin a pancake, it has two sides.” It’s a simple but powerful reminder to consider multiple perspectives in conflicts or debates.<sup>20</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Habit Missed Twice Is a New Habit</strong><br>
Skip a good habit once, no big deal. Skip it twice, and you’re on your way to a new (bad) habit.<sup>21</sup> Consistency is the key—if you slip, correct course immediately.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="business-marketing-insights" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="business-marketing-insights">Business &amp; Marketing Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Product vs.&nbsp;Marketing</strong><br>
Getting the product right is crucial, but achieving <em>escape velocity</em> for your business often hinges on marketing—specifically the stories you tell. A merely “okay” product with great storytelling can outsell a brilliant product with no marketing. The best scenario is both: a product people love and a compelling narrative.<sup>22</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grey Goose: A Branding Masterclass</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>France over Russia:</strong> Leveraged French luxury connotations.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Top-Shelf Pricing:</strong> 30% higher than the competition, creating a perception of high quality.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Tall Bottle Design:</strong> Forced bars to place it on the top shelf, cementing its premium status.<sup>23</sup><br>
A reminder that marketing—especially price, packaging, and provenance—can transform a commodity (vodka) into a billion-dollar brand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Speak to an Audience of One</strong><br>
Narrow your focus to a single, ideal audience member, and your content becomes more personal, resonant, and effective. Ironically, by writing to “everyone,” you often connect with no one.<sup>24</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Growth for Growth’s Sake = Cancer</strong><br>
Mindlessly chasing growth (in business or life) can be destructive. As Edward Abbey said, “growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell”.<sup>25</sup> Pursue meaningful growth with a purpose, not expansion at all costs.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="productivity-success" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="productivity-success">Productivity &amp; Success</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learn to Say “No”</strong><br>
Successful people say no to almost everything, focusing on the select few activities that truly matter.<sup>26</sup> Time and energy are finite resources—guard them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Take Simple Ideas Seriously</strong><br>
Complexity doesn’t guarantee success. Sometimes a simple idea, executed with extraordinary focus, can outshine more elaborate plans. Think of Amazon starting with just online book sales.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Hard Path Brings Happiness</strong><br>
The path of least resistance rarely leads to fulfillment. Progress—often uncomfortable—makes you happy.<sup>27</sup> Growth happens when you embrace challenges, not avoid them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grow or Die, Then Give</strong><br>
Feeling stuck? Commit to continuous growth—new skills, knowledge, or goals—so you have more to offer others. Giving back then fuels your sense of purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Success Without Fulfillment = Failure</strong><br>
What’s the point of external “success” if you feel empty inside? True success should include joy and meaning.<sup>28</sup></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timing Is Everything</strong><br>
Doing the right thing at the wrong time often yields zero results. Whether in business or life, <em>when</em> you act can matter as much as <em>what</em> you do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Everything Is Networks</strong><br>
Your career, friendships, and opportunities revolve around the networks you enter and exit—schools, companies, regions, or social circles.<sup>29</sup> Being in the right network at the right time can change everything. Pick your networks wisely, and reciprocate value within them.</p></li>

<p>The simplest, yet often most powerful, models in time series forecasting are the oldest. These models are univariate approaches that are more statistics than new age machine learning. Univariate means that they only rely on previous values of the target variable to predict future values of that target variable. Just a timestamp and a target variable is all you need to get off the ground with univariate models.</p>
<p>This might sound too simple, but often it’s <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-05-03-time-series-simple-models/">the simplest models that can create the best forecasts</a>.</p>

<section id="trends-are-hard" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trends-are-hard">Trends Are Hard</h3>
<p>In the world of forecasting, many models need the trend component to be removed in order to learn the right signal from the data. The process of removing a trend (and sometimes seasonality) is called differencing, which can make a time series become stationary.</p>
<p>Stationary just means that the time series has a constant mean and variance over time. Put simpler, it’s a time series that looks kind of random with no discernable trend or repeating seasonality. If a time series does have a trend, then we can remove it through a process called differencing, which involves subtracting a value in one time period from a value in a previous time period. More on this later.</p>
<p>Some models need data to be stationary to ensure it’s learning the correct relationships in the data, and doesn’t get fooled from thinking trends will always remain the same.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at one of our time series. Does it look like it has a constant mean and variance over time?</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Hmmm, not really. Seems like there is an upward trend to the data. This means that the mean over time will also rise. It probably also has a slightly growing variance. Meaning the year over year growth amount is getting bigger and bigger. Let’s see what we can do to make this data stationary through differencing.</p>
</section>
<section id="types-of-differencing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-differencing">Types of Differencing</h3>
<p>There are two main types of differencing. The first is simply taking the difference between two consecutive periods. For example taking the sales in December and subtracting the sales in November (previous month). This is called first order differencing. Let’s try that on our time series and see what happens.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Ok it’s looking a lot better! Our data is centered around zero, and doesn’t seem to be growing in magnitude over time. Seems like it could be stationary! Another way to apply differencing is by doing it twice, this is called second order differencing. You start by doing a first order difference, then do that same process again on that data. So instead of ending up with the change from period to period. You have the change of the change from period to period.</p>
<ul>
<li>A first order difference measures the change in position over time, which is like velocity</li>
<li>A second order difference measures the rate of change of the rate of change, which is like acceleration (the change in velocity over time)</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a second order difference is done when the time series still doesn’t have constant mean or variance. Let’s take a second order difference of our example time series.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Things changed a little, but not much. Seems like a second order difference may not always be necessary. The final way to difference your time series is through seasonal differencing. This is the difference between an observation and the previous observation from the same season. For example with monthly sales, a season difference would be taking the difference between a month this year and the same month in the previous year. Taking a seasonal difference removes most seasonality in the data, hence the name. Let’s see how our data looks by just taking a seasonal difference.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The seasonal difference result looks good. Constant mean and variance throughout time. You can also combine both standard differencing with seasonal differencing. If your data has some seasonality, it’s best to do the seasonal difference first, then take the first order difference after. Let’s see how it looks.</p>
<p><img src="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-03-21-ts-fundamentals-data-cleaning-stationary/chart5.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We now have a nice mean around zero and no major variance throughout the data. Nice! But how the heck do we know if the data is stationary once we difference it?</p>
</section>
<section id="checking-if-your-data-is-stationary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="checking-if-your-data-is-stationary">Checking if Your Data is Stationary</h3>
<p>In order to check if the data is stationary, either the original data or data that’s been differenced, you can use something called a unit root test. Specially a Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. This kind of test runs a few statistical processes and lets you know if the data it was fed was stationary or not. We can take this once step further by leveraging tools that build on this test and tell you how many differences should be applied on your data.</p>
<p>Let’s try running this test on our data and see how many differences we might need to make the data stationary.</p>
<ul>
<li>First order difference: stationary ✅</li>
<li>Second order difference: stationary ✅</li>
<li>Seasonal difference: stationary ✅</li>
<li>Seasonal and first order difference : stationary ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweet! All of our differencing techniques each resulted in our data being stationary. It’s a good idea to pick the method that is the simplest way to get a stationary time series, which in our case is the first order difference. So we can use that going forward when training models.</p>
</section>
<section id="back-transformations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-transformations">Back Transformations</h3>
<p>After you train a model and produce a forecast, the work is still not done. That forecast is the predicting the change between periods, not the actual values for that period. In order to get a final forecast we can use we need to transform that data back to the original units.</p>
<p>To do this we need all original values of the time series. When we difference our data, the process creates missing values at the start of the time series, because we cannot calculate the difference of the first period of the data since it’s the first period of the data. So a first order difference has one missing value at the start of the time series, a second order difference has 2, and a seasonal difference has many more depending on the seasonal periods in the data.</p>
<p>To get our final forecast we need to keep these original values, add them back to the differenced data, then start to add them up one by one. For a first order difference, that just means taking that original value in the first period, adding it to the differenced value in the second period, then adding that new value to the differenced value in the third period, and so on. It’s a daisy chained process to get the original data back. We carry this math forward into the future with our predictions, with the final output being our finished forecast!</p>

<section id="reversal" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reversal">Reversal</h3>
<p>There are cases where differencing your data to ensure it’s stationary is not a good idea. Some models, like arima, have the differencing process built in. So you don’t need to do it beforehand. Other models, like standard linear regressions, don’t need stationary data at all since they can easily learn from trends and seasonal patterns in the data.</p>
<p>Differencing the data can also limit model interpretability, or the ability to explain the forecasted outputs. This becomes even harder once you start to difference your data two or more times, since you are not explaining changes between observations, but instead the change in the changes or even worse. This becomes near impossible to understand for any regular human that might use your forecasts.</p>
<p>A final thing to call out with differencing is that it can remove historical data from the beginning of your time series. This may not be a big deal with a first order difference, but taking a seasonal difference on a monthly data set will remove the first 12 months of the time series. That may not be impactful if you have 10+ years of historical data, but if you only have 3 years to start with this becomes very detrimental to the process. That’s why I try to limit any seasonal differencing when the amount of historical data is low.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Stationarity is fundamental to reliable forecasting because it ensures your models are learning stable, meaningful patterns rather than temporary or misleading trends. A stationary time series maintains a constant mean and variance over time, making its behavior predictable and easier for statistical models to learn from.</p>
<p>Differencing is a powerful yet straightforward way to achieve stationarity, paving the path for more accurate forecasts. While simple first-order differencing often does the trick, be cautious with higher-order or seasonal differences, as they can reduce interpretability, remove valuable historical context, and complicate back transformations. Always prioritize the simplest approach that achieves stationarity, keeping both modeling and explanations clear and intuitive. Ultimately, knowing how—and when—to apply stationarity transformations is key to building robust, effective forecasts.</p>

  <title>Your Genes Are Making You Sick</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="what-gets-measured-gets-managed" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-gets-measured-gets-managed">What Gets Measured, Gets Managed</h3>
<p>Our bodies are mostly a mystery to a regular person. Everyone takes vitamins, but do they actually help your body operate better? If you don’t know what kind of vitamins your body needs, there’s a good chance supplements you take every day are actively hurting your body or are simply being pissed down the drain (literally). Nobody wants to take something that is a waste of time. So how do you know what nutrients your body needs? This is where understanding methylation in your body comes in.</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-methylation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-methylation">What’s Methylation?</h3>
<p>Methylation is the process of converting nutrients you eat into things your body can actually use. We eat crude oil in the form of food, and our body uses methylation to process it into gasoline in to use for various processes that help us thrive. The issue is that our body rarely does this all perfectly. Many of us have gene mutations that inhibit this kind of conversation process. Let’s walk through some of the most common gene mutations around methylation and see how we can make sure our bodies are operating at their maximal potential.</p>
</section>
<section id="mthfr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mthfr">MTHFR</h3>
<p>Commonly known as the “mother fucker” gene, this one can be a real mother fucker. Up to 44% of people in the world carry this gene mutation. MTHFR deals with how our body handles the nutrient called folate. It translates the folate we get from our food into a form our bodies can use called methylfolate or 5-MTHF, which is the methylated version of folate.</p>
<p>5-MTHF helps break down a compound in our body called homocysteine. Which is one of the most inflammatory compound in the human body. Inflammation is very bad for our body folks. When this compound is high all crazy types of things happen. Here are just a couple of things that are impacted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating neurotransmitters</li>
<li>DNA repair</li>
<li>Detoxing</li>
<li>Regulating blood pressure</li>
<li>Miscarriages during pregnancy</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
</ul>
<p>Folate can be found in leafy greens and legumes. But the most common way we consume folate is through a compound called folic acid. Folic acid is the most common additive to our food. It’s literally everywhere. White rice and can flour contain folic acid. When ingredients say “fortified” or “enriched”, that means folic acid was added. This is bad news for people with the MTHFR mutation because they cannot process folic acid into the form our body needs. I will repeat, folic acid is the most common additive in food but cannot be properly processed by almost half of the worlds population. It’s even found in some prenatal vitamins, which has been linked to miscarriages and postpartum depression. Not good!</p>
<p>I know this is kind of scary to read, but thankfully there is some good news. There are easy ways to work around this gene mutation and ensure you are thriving in life. Here’s what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid all forms of folic acid, which limits your processed food intake, which is a major health win overall</li>
<li>Take the methylated version of folate, <a href="https://a.co/d/4TwoR4o">called 5-MTHF</a>, at night before going to bed</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="mtr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mtr">MTR</h3>
<p>Similar to MTHFR, the MTR gene also plays in a role in regulating homocysteine by converting it into another compound called methionine. For this reaction to work, your body needs vitamin B12, specifically the methylated versions of B12 like methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin.</p>
<p>If you have this gene mutation, you may experience certain gut issues like these.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Bloating</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Constipation</li>
<li>Cramping</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplementing with B12 is crucial for this gene mutation, but similar to MTHFR not all supplements are created equal. Stay away from a form of B12 called Cyanocobalamin. This form contains hydrogen cyanide, which is a known neurotoxin. It’s often added into cheap energy drinks and even milk! Companies do this because it’s cheap and they don’t care, so care for yourself and avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do if you have this gene mutation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit alcohol, which depletes methyl donors and can interfere with B12 absorption</li>
<li>Avoid heavy metals (like mercury and lead) that bind to B12, making it unavailable for MTR to use</li>
<li>Take the methylated version of B12, either methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin found in <a href="https://a.co/d/fHQiO9z">methylated multivitamins</a>
<ul>
<li>FYI not everyone can process methylcobalamin, but 100% of humans can process hydroxocobalamin in their body</li>
<li>If you also have the COMT gene mutation, you absolutely should be taking hydroxocobalamin since your body can process that better than other forms like methylcobalamin</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="mtrr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mtrr">MTRR</h3>
<p>This gene works closely with the MTR gene, hence similar names. It helps reactivate B12 that was used by the MTR gene when converting homocysteine into methionine. Over time B12 can become oxidized when used by the MTR gene, so MTRR comes in to convert it back into its methylated form so it can be properly used again. MTRR is also important in the thyroid, helping convert one important thyroid hormone T4 into T3, which happens in your gut.</p>
<p>If you have this gene mutation, you might suffer from the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart burn</li>
<li>Acid reflux</li>
<li>Thyroid issues</li>
<li>Short temper</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Exacerbations of ADD, ADHD, OCD</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the same guidelines as described in the MTR section above. Avoid the wrong types of B12 and make sure to take versions that your body can actually use.</p>
</section>
<section id="ahcy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ahcy">AHCY</h3>
<p>This gene helps break down S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) into homocysteine and adenosine. This process is critical because SAH is a strong inhibitor of methylation enzymes. If it builds up, it slows down methylation reactions throughout the body. SAH is one of the most inflammatory compounds in your body, even worse than homocysteine.</p>
<p>This is a rare gene mutation to have, but people with it can have addictive tendencies. For example, addiction to video games as kids, then phones as teenagers, then drugs, alcohol, sugar, working out, eating, sex, shopping, working. This is caused by wide ranges in dopamine in the body, which is tied to our behaviors. So people with this mutation tend to seek out dopamine rewarding behavior.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do if you have this gene mutation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consume collagen to ensure your ingesting enough glycine to help your body balance methionine. If AHCY isn’t efficiently breaking down SAH, excess methionine intake might lead to toxic byproducts instead of proper methylation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="comt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comt">COMT</h3>
<p>This gene breaks down major neurotransmitters in the body. Things like dopamine and adrenaline. It’s also responsible for metabolizing estrogens, and having too much of this hormone for both men and women can be bad. When your body can’t break these these things, all sorts of things get out of whack.</p>
<p>If you have this gene mutation, you might suffer from the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stress and anxiety</li>
<li>Trouble winding down and sleeping</li>
<li>Quick to anger, slow to calm down</li>
<li>Higher estrogen levels, which can lead to water retention under the belly button and around the waist</li>
<li>Pain sensitivity</li>
<li>ADD or ADHD</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully it’s not all bad with this gene mutation. Because things like dopamine stay around longer in your brain, it can lead to higher creativity and deep thinking. But this comes at a cost of overanalyzing and worrying.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do if you have this gene mutation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid green tea and quercitin (found in green tea and other supplements) at all costs. These can make your COMT symptoms much worse.</li>
<li>If you have excess water retention around your belly, look into taking a <a href="https://a.co/d/8Af2hyP">diindolylmethane (DIM) supplement</a>, which can help reduce that water retention by removing excess estrogen in your body.</li>
<li>Consider taking a <a href="https://a.co/d/eZ5ui5I">trimethylglycine (TMG) supplement</a>, which can help regulate the processes that maintain your neurotransmitters</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-they-all-connect" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-they-all-connect">How They All Connect</h3>
<p>Processes in our body can be thought of like a group of construction workers passing sandbags to each other in a single line. One gene can do a process the body needs, then pass the output along to another gene to do another process, and so on. But if one of those genes can only pass along 4 sandbags instead of the 10 needed, then the most any of the downstream genes will get is 40% of what’s required.</p>
<p>This is why understanding genetic methylation in our bodies is so important. Each of these 5 genes play a crucial role in making our bodies work.</p>
<p>Let’s do a recap of each gene and what they do in our methylation process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MTHFR starts the process by making active folate (5-MTHF)</li>
<li>MTR uses 5-MTHF &amp; B12 to convert homocysteine into methionine</li>
<li>MTRR keeps MTR working by recharging B12</li>
<li>AHCY clears out byproducts and provides fresh homocysteine</li>
<li>COMT uses methylation to break down stress chemicals and estrogen</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these genes don’t work well, the whole system slows down! The fix is to support each gene with the right nutrients and to avoid things your body may not be able to handle.</p>
</section>
<section id="dna-testing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dna-testing">DNA Testing</h3>
<p>How the heck do I know if I have any gene mutations? This is where testing comes in. There are a lot of services out there that will do a genetic methylation test for you. They cost a few hundred dollars, but it’s a test you only need to run once in your life.</p>
<p>It’s a simple cheek swab you do at home then mail in. I used a service called <a href="https://10xhealthsystem.com/genetest/">10X Health</a>, but there are many providers out there who can help.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>I got my results back about a month ago, and things did not look good. I had mutations in all 5 genes except AHCY, with the MTHFR and COMT genes having the strongest mutation (meaning they don’t work). These results are kind of like getting a personality test result. You start to understand who you are as a person more. Why you act and feel a certain way. You start to understand your parents and siblings so much more, because they most likely carry similar genes as you. It’s life changing to receive information that shows you how to live a better life with 100% certainty.</p>
<p>My gene results showed that I had to really crack down on folic acid (MTHFR gene) and green tea/quercetin (COMT). I realized some of my most beloved foods and supplements, that are supposed to be healthy, actually contain things that are the worst to put into my body. Since cleaning those up I have had an easier time falling asleep, and my brain is working better than ever. It’s also been easier to avoid processed food, because I know almost all of it contains things that my body cannot handle well. So the temptation to binge on them has been removed. Thank goodness!</p>
<p>If you’d like to live up to your highest potential in life. Consider taking control of your genetics and get tested! It might just change your life.

<p>I love reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, you name it. Anything learning related is my jam. But I realized that if I don’t take notes on what I’m learning, I will probably forget everything. Now when I hear something interesting, I write it down in an Apple note for that month. Below are some of the learnings I jotted down in February, summarized by ChatGPT with additional context added by their new deep research feature. I hope you find them as interesting as I did.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="a-man-must-have-a-code" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-man-must-have-a-code">A Man Must Have a Code</h3>
<p>Every person lives by a set of principles that govern their actions throughout life. They are either principles inherited by the society they were raised in (unconsciously), or principles that were chosen and updated by a person on their own (consciously). The best principles in life are ones you have thought through yourself. Below are the top principles I like to live my life by.</p>
</section>
<section id="bias-for-action" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bias-for-action">Bias for Action</h3>
<p>Action is the best answer to most problems. Sitting around waiting for something to happen to you rarely works out. No one ever get’s lucky sitting on their couch watching Netflix. Action creates luck, creates feedback, and also creates momentum.</p>
</section>
<section id="sense-of-urgency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sense-of-urgency">Sense of Urgency</h3>
<p>Life is short, and timelines are negotiable. Ever heard of the parkinson principle? It states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Got an important work project due in a month? It will probably take you a month to do. Does the same project need to be done by Friday? Then you will also probably finish it Friday morning.</p>
<p>Reality is negotiable. Peter Thiel has a saying: “If you have a 10 year plan of how to get somewhere, you should ask: why can’t I do this in 6 months?”. The quality of your questions determines the quality of your life.</p>
<p>When you combine a sense of urgency with a bias for action, you become an unstoppable force. This brings us to my next principle.</p>
</section>
<section id="high-agency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="high-agency">High Agency</h3>
<p>Who would you call to break you out of a third world prison? That person has a high sense of agency, which means they have have the ability to control what happens to them in life. Think of it as the opposite of a victim mentality. Agency is the combination of a bias for action with a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>George Mack does a good job discussing agency. <a href="https://x.com/george__mack/status/1661426260327759902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1661426260327759902%7Ctwgr%5E7eacc97032d4e2d008f3d1d669bb67c347937b2c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.beehiiv.com%2Flogin%3F_gl%3D11bn3wdj_gaNTI1OTM1NjEuMTY4NjMyNDQzMg.._ga_E6Y4WLQ2ECMTY4NjMyNDQzMi4xLjAuMTY4NjMyNDQzMi42MC4wLjA.&amp;utm_source=clouds-and-dirt.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=lindy-library-the-0-1-of-ideas-i-ve-found">Here is a good example</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="zero-expectations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="zero-expectations">Zero Expectations</h3>
<p>When Charlie Munger was asked about what it takes to live a happy life his response was simple, have low expectations. In a similar vein, Naval Ravikant states that happiness is a simple equation. Happiness = Reality - Expectations.</p>
<p>If you came to Seattle in January and expected it to be warm and sunny, you’d be bummed out if it was 50 degrees with a slight drizzle. Instead if you came expecting it to be cold and constantly raining, then you’d be pleasantly surprised to find out that it didn’t rain much at all. The same external events happened in both examples, but the change in expectations made for a better outcome.</p>
<p>It’s ok to have high expectations for yourself, but having high expectations over things in life you can’t control is a recipe for disaster.</p>
</section>
<section id="time-over-money" class="level3">

<p>Control over how you spend your time is the ultimate freedom and source of power. It’s the life razor I use to make most decisions in my life.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="love-over-power">Love Over Power</h3>
<p>Most things we chase in life are a <a href="https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-03-13-power-pursuits/">form of power</a>. Money, status, fame, beauty, these are all forms of power. They will not make you fulfilled in life. You know what will? Love.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="giving-without-getting">Giving Without Getting</h3>
<p>Giving away my time, attention, and skills with no expectations of something in return is very important to me. Nothing grinds my gears like someone doing a good deed in the world then immediately posting about it on social media. They are giving with the intention of receiving status in return. Giving yourself to others is an amazing act in and of itself, full stop.</p>

<section id="stay-present" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stay-present">Stay Present</h3>
<p>If you think about the future, you are anxious. If you think about the past, you are depressed. Staying in the future moment is the best way to live a happy and purpose filled life.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stagnation-is-death">Stagnation is Death</h3>
<p>If you are coasting, you are going downhill. Always be learning, always be evolving. If you are not learning, you are dying.</p>

<section id="keep-it-simple" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keep-it-simple">Keep it Simple</h3>
<p>The best solutions to problems in life are the simplest. Keep it simple stupid.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incentives-matter">Incentives Matter</h3>
<p>Charlie Munger once said “show me the incentive and I’ll show you the behavior”. Incentives rule most things in life. Use the right incentive and you will change your life, and maybe the world.</p>
</section>
<section id="run-towards-fear" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-towards-fear">Run Towards Fear</h3>
<p>Usually the things you are the most afraid of are the most important things that you need to do to improve your life. Scared of public speaking? Then getting good at it will probably change your life more than anything else.</p>
</section>
<section id="allergic-to-status" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="allergic-to-status">Allergic to Status</h3>
<p>Increasing your status will not create a fulfilling life. So I try not to do things that inflate my status. Comparison is the thief of joy. Never compare yourself to others (aka your status compared to others), only compare yourself to who you were yesterday.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-things-worth-writing-write-things-worth-reading" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-things-worth-writing-write-things-worth-reading">Do Things Worth Writing, Write Things Worth Reading</h3>
<p>This is a quote from Ben Franklin. I think it’s a great life philosophy. I try to do both interesting things, and write interesting things. Heck, you are hopefully reading something interesting right now!</p>
</section>
<section id="what-would-you-do-if-you-couldnt-fail" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-would-you-do-if-you-couldnt-fail">What Would You Do If You Couldn’t Fail?</h3>
<p>This is a fantastic question to ask yourself. It can help you determine your career path and most of your major decisions in life. If you are stuck in your career, asking this question can point you in the right direction.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-makes-for-the-best-story" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-for-the-best-story">What Makes for the Best Story?</h3>
<p>Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, uses this question as the final decision framework for big life moves. When deciding between two paths, taking the one that makes for the better story will almost always create a better life for you. Choose wisely.</p>
</section>
<section id="did-i-always-do-my-best" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="did-i-always-do-my-best">Did I Always Do My Best?</h3>
<p>John Wooden says that “success is the peace of mind that is the direct result of self-satisfaction knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming”. He didn’t care about the score of the game, he only cared that his players rose to their full potential. If they did that, everything else will take care of itself. Even if they lost, they still were at peace because they knew they did their best. This is a powerful idea and one that people today seem to overlook.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-be-the-best-be-the-only" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-be-the-best-be-the-only">Don’t Be the Best, Be the Only</h3>
<p>This comes from the law of category from a book called <a href="https://a.co/d/9bse5C6">The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing</a>. It’s better to be the first person in a new industry than to be the 10th person. Finding things that you are the only person in the world doing is a good place to be.</p>

<section id="stop-trying-to-sound-smart" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stop-trying-to-sound-smart">Stop Trying to Sound Smart</h3>
<p>I’ve had to learn this one the hard way. Stop trying to be right all of the time. Stop trying to one up people with more interesting facts or stories. Stop correcting people. Once you stop, the quality of your relationships improve, which improves your entire life.</p>
</section>
<section id="hard-choices-easy-life.-easy-choices-hard-life." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hard-choices-easy-life.-easy-choices-hard-life.">Hard Choices, Easy Life. Easy Choices, Hard Life.</h3>
<p>This comes from Jerzy Gregorek. If you make the easy choice of eating junk food today, your life will become much harder in the future once you develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But if you make the hard choices of diet and exercise today, future you will be happy and healthy. This approach applies to most things in life. Hard now, easy later.</p>

<section id="gear-over-stuff" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gear-over-stuff">Gear Over Stuff</h3>
<p>This was outlined in Michael Easter’s book called <a href="https://a.co/d/2GHLZeR">Scarcity Brain</a>. Having more stuff in my life weighs me down, increasing stress. Instead gear serves a purpose in your life. You can have tons of stuff, but only so much gear.</p>
</section>
<section id="avoid-scarcity-loops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoid-scarcity-loops">Avoid Scarcity Loops</h3>
<p>This is the main concept outlined in Michael Easter’s book called <a href="https://a.co/d/2GHLZeR">Scarcity Brain</a>. It has three parts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Opportunity</li>
<li>Unpredictable Rewards</li>
<li>Quick Repeatability</li>
</ol>
<p>Scarcity loops are built to make us crave certain behaviors that are most likely not good for us. Once you learn this you see it everywhere. Let’s take checking your email. It’s easy to open the app on your phone (opportunity), you may or may not have any new unread emails (unpredictable rewards), and you can easily recheck for new emails five minutes later (quick repeatability). Checking your email constantly is obviously not good for you, but scarcity loops change your behavior for the worst. There are also scarcity loops on social media, junk food, drinking, drugs, gambling, online shopping, and literally anything else that is not healthy for you.</p>
<p>Avoid them at all cost.</p>

<section id="the-most-important-question" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-most-important-question">The Most Important Question</h3>
<p>Josh Waitzkin has a framework called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnGtVDU-Yw4&amp;t">the most important question</a> that helps train you on discovering what matters most. Knowing where to focus your energy is often more important than how hard you work at something. Remember, the quality of your questions determines the quality of your life. So being able to think about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfv2d1ItzOQ">the most important question to solve</a> for in your job, marriage, etc. is paramount.</p>

<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>To live a quality life you must have quality principles. If you don’t, you will be easily influenced to live an unauthentic life based on the expectations of society. Feel free to take some of mine to use as your own principles, or don’t! I could care less, because I have zero expectations about people reading this post.</p>
