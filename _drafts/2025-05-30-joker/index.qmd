- Dark Knight is a perfect movie because you learn just as much from the good guy as the bad guy. That's rare. Both teach you quality life lessons. 
- Says he hates rules but in reality he has his own strong set of principles. Hates batman for having rules but in reality he has his own. 
- You can just do things, like a dog chasing a car. High degree of agency. He says he makes it up as he goes along but he's always five steps ahead. Very strong strategic mind and vision. 
- Likes cheap things. Did buy a custom suit, but it's one of a kind and is the only thing he wears. 
- Mystery is power (no tags on clothes, no id, no one knows anything about him).
- Joker and Batman have principles and won't budge. Does this make them both noble? 
- The only true bad guy is Harvey Dent, who had strong values but gave them up after facing setbacks in life. You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. This is only true if you change for the worse. First he did things the right way, then he started doing things the easy way, then he started doing things the wrong way. 
    - "Endure master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of the batman. He can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make, the right choice."
- Joker won't kill the batman, he wants someone to push him. Having healthy stress in life is good for you. 
- He proposes to kill the batman, and asks for half of the money. Says if you're good at something never do it for free. 
- I'm a man of my word, the Joker does what he says. No lies. 
- Criminal's are not complicated Alfred, we just have to understand what he's after. 
- Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn. 
    - A part from burning the world, you could use the same description for some of histories greatest people. Entrepreneurs, world leaders, scientists, etc.
- You got rules, the Joker, he has no rules. Salvatore Moroney. They think he's a savage but he has rules. 
- Nothing. No matches on prints, dna, dental. Clothing is custom, no labels. Nothing is his pockets except knives and lint. No name, no other alias. 
- I wanted to see what you'd do. And you didn't disappoint. You let five people die. Then you let Dent take your place. Even to a guy like me that's cold. 
- I don't want to kill you. What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers, no no no. You complete me. 
- You see, their morals, their code, is a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show ya, when the chips are down, these civilized people will eat each other. See I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve. 
- You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you. 
- The only sensible way to live in the world is without rules. 
- You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with, nothing to do with all your strength. 
- I want my phone call. 
- The joker planned to be caught, he wanted me to lock him up in the MCU. 
- That bandit, in burma, did you catch him? Yes. How? We burned the forest down. 
- You see I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite, and gunpowder, and gasoline. And you know the thing they have in common? They're cheap. 
- You said you were a man of your word? Oh I am. I'm only burning my half. All you care about is money. This town deserves a better class of criminal. And I'm going to give it to them. 
- It's not about money, it's about sending a message. Everything burns. 
- You're mem your plan. Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught one. You know, I just do things. You're a schemer, you had plans, and look where that gotcha. 
- I just did what I do best. I took your little plan and I turned it on itself. You know what I noticed, no one panics when things go according to plan. Even if the plan is horrifying. 
- Criminals on the ferry throwing the detonator overboard.
