I've been doing time series forecasting with machine learning (ML) most of my career. I believe it's still the best AI opportunity in corporate finance, even with all of the latest Generative AI developments in recent years. If you work for the CFO, chances are you often create predictions about the future. Those predictions take time and can always be more accurate. Machine learning can help in both areas. Before you want to explore building machine learning solutions in your finance org, it's important to understand the true building blocks of making good forecasts. Let's dive right in to each first principle. 

### 1. Domain Expertise

Any data scientist worth their salt can create a time series forecast for you. They can pull some data, train some models, and give you a forecast. All with you out of the loop. If that's the case at your company, run! This is a big red flag. While that can sometimes yield good results, most of the time the most important ingredient is missing, which is strong domain expertise about what you're trying to forecast. This is where strong understanding of the business and market forces come into play. You know, the stuff that finance people excel at. Pairing robust ML models with strong domain expertise about the area being forecasted always yields the most accurate forecast. It also increases trust in that forecast, since the humans using that forecast know that the model took into account important factors that influence the business. 

How does domain expertise change how a ML model is created? This can manifest in many forms. The most common is changing the kind of data used in training a model. Data that a model learns from are called "features". A good example is in forecasting real estate expenses at a company. In the last few years, COVID and the work from home revolution have absolutely changed how people come into work. This changes how many people drink coffee, use the copier, and even which buildings stay in operation for a company. Simply pulling historical building expense data and training a model could maybe get you ok results, but to get to peak performance you need domain expertise around what actually moves the needle for building expenses. Example features could be the square footage of a building, how many people actually badge into that building each month, even the periods where COVID was at its worse and a work from home mandate was in effect. All of these things are custom knowledge, most likely kept inside the heads of the finance workers who oversee the real estate space within a finance org.
