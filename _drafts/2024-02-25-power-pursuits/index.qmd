A few years ago I was at dinner with a few friends. Out of the blue one of them asked me "what is the meaning of life?". Without thinking I blurted out "love". That in the end everything comes down to love. It sounded cheesy and cliche coming out of my mouth. Over the years, I have thought about it more and now think more than ever that it's the right answer. 

What most people want in life can mostly be boiled down to the pursuit and gaining of power. Some types of power are good for you, but the most common ones always leave you unfulfilled. You know what does fulfil you though? Love. It fills you up better than power ever could. Let's review how most things we chase in life are just hidden forms of power.

### Types of Unfulfilling Power

Starting with unfulfilling power. These are things that can be attained in ok ways, but doing them just for the pursuit of having it is a good way to waste your life. 

1. **Money**: This is an easy one. Having more money is the biggest form of power most people chase in life. It's the most popular game people play, and having more is never enough. Granted you want to get to a certain level of money to have a good life, but after that the more money you have the less fulfilled it makes you.
2. **Status**: This is power over how people in society look at you. There are many ways to get status. Going to an elite college and working at a prestigious job are ways to gain status. You also gain status about how you spend your money. Living in a fancy house in a fancy neighborhood punches a ticket to a different level of status than someone living in a trailer park. Imagine someone telling you at a friends party that they live in a double wide trailer next to a highway compared to someone saying they own a two story apartment in Manhattan. The way you perceive that person immediately changes. They could be a billionaire who just likes the simple life of a trailer, or someone deep in debt who spent everything on a fancy NYC apartment. That information doesn't get shared, but what people do see is what you own, and most people own certain things to convey status. Does a Rolex tell more accurate time than your phone? No but it shows that you are the type of person who can spend $10,000 minimum on an accessory you don't really need.   
3. ***Beauty**: Having power over others attention and sexual desires. This is a weird one because it can either be gained naturally (just being born) or through external means (botox, plastic surgery). If two people came to sell you a similar product, and they both had the same skill as a salesperson, it might be hard to choose which one to buy from. What if one of them looked like Brad Pitt from Fight Club and another like
