On new years day of 2015, I got an email from a Microsoft recruiter to schedule a phone screen for Microsoft's Finance Rotation Program (FRP). A week after the phone screen, I was reading the book "The Alchemist" (link to Alchemist) during a study break and started to think about my personal legend (link to personal legend). I thought Microsoft would be a good opportunity and hoped for another interview. That's right when my phone rang, it was the recruiter informing me that I was about to be chosen for the final super day in February. The weekend before the big interview in Redmond, my brother got me tickets to see the Oklahoma City Thunder take on the LA Clippers, a present for my 21st birthday. I told him I couldn't go, because I needed time to prepare for the biggest interview of my life. Laughing, he said I had nothing to worry about, I would get the job, and we can use this weekend to celebrate the new job. His confidence in me, and the uncanny coincidence with the Alchemist book, were the "omens I'd follow" into my own personal legend. Thankfully the interview went well, I got the offer, and the rest is history. 

The Finance Rotation Program at Microsoft is a two year program where recent college graduates complete four rotations across various groups in finance, each lasting six months. It's a great opportunity to learn about different parts of Microsoft's business, while also being a world class "try it before you buy it" experience for finding your optimal career path. You get to find what your destined to do, and Microsoft get's a well rounded finance professional that is tuned into the exact job they want long term. A true win-win.

I often get asked to talk about my experience from would be FRP's still in school and existing FRP's. My career path in the FRP is nontraditional in nature, but is hopefully one anyone with enough high agency can do as well. I write this to those high agency folks. People who want to do interesting things in the world and help others. What follows is my path in the FRP and what I recommend for today's FRP's.  

## Rotations

### Internship: Venture Integration

I came into the FRP as an intern in the summer of 2015, the same summer Microsoft launched Windows 10. It was a fun time to join finance at Microsoft. Satya Nadella was only installed as CEO a few years back, same as Amy Hood the CFO. The stock price was in the 40s and no one thought Microsoft was doing anything cool or exciting. Safe to say most students at my college had MacBook's instead of Surface's. 

The Venture Integration team was responsible for helping acquired companies integrate successfully into Microsoft. While Corporate Development teams work on closing the deal, the Venture Integration team does everything else. From doing due diligence on the companies financial statements, digging through the products source code, all the way to determining if the acquired CEO would move to Redmond. It was a cool space to be in. Code names were used for each deal, and the deal flow was strong. Often we started a new deal every two weeks. 

My role on the team didn't involve running deals, although I did get to help with modeling the integration costs for one deal. I was tasked with running the quarterly scorecard process. This involved a lot of cat herding. For each recently closed deal, I would track down metrics to see if we were on track for a successful integration into Microsoft. This was more project management and less about financial modeling or analysis. The cool part was on the last day of my internship I completed the scorecard powerpoint and personally sent it to the CFO for review, who would then share it with the board of directors. So, in a way, I got to work on something that Bill Gate's got to see. Most likely it was buried in the appendix of the board materials but I know my guy Bill loves to read! So I'm sure he say it and was blown away by my excellence. At least that's what I tell myself. 

The life changing moment for me happened towards the end of the summer. The tech team responsible for reviewing the code of acquired companies hosted a brown bag lunch session about a new service called "Azure Machine Learning Studio". They demoed a drag and drop tool that could build a machine learning model to predict if an event was going to happen or not. With a few clicks of their mouse they had a working model up and running in a self-serve UI. Only a few lines of code were written, with most of the magic happening in predefined lego blocks they pieced together. My mind was blown. It seemed like a magic trick to me, and I had to figure out how they did it. In school I always loved building three statement financial models to value a companies stock price. The biggest assumption we had to make was around future revenue growth, and that number was always made up. You could say xyz company's revenue will continue to grow 10% because of xyz reason, but in the end it was a guess. The fact that you could build a machine learning model to create a more accurate prediction of the future was astounding to me, and I had to learn more. 

Within a week after that presentation, all of the FRP interns got to meet with the CFO. A lot of questions were asked. I'm not even sure who asked it but a question around AI was asked. Amy said that AI and machine learning will become very important in finance one day, and it will be an important skill for everyone to know. There are few moments of pure clarity in a lifetime where everything comes together and makes perfect sense. This was one of those moments for me. I had to figure out this AI thing. I had absolutely no clue how to start. I was only a finance major with zero technical skills. What I lacked in hard skills I made up for with enthusiasm to go figure it out any way possible. 

The internship ended and thankfully I got the return offer. I remember the head of the FRP looking at my manager during the final review meeting. She said, "should you tell him or should I tell him". My heart dropped, I thought I messed up and wasn't getting the offer. Thankfully that confusion was cleared up real fast and I had a return offer in my hand. How can I say no to an opportunity to come back to Microsoft? Within a week back at school I accepted the offer and had total peace of mind going into my final year of undergrad. 

### First Rotation: Windows COGS

My first rotation was a classic rhythm of business (ROB) rotation in the world of Windows, Microsoft's oldest business. It was a great place to earn my sea legs in traditional FP&A work. I was responsible for owning the royalty portfolio for "codec" payments. Basically there is special software needed to read/write disks that are inserted into an optical drive on a computer. That software comes from companies like Dolbe, and Microsoft had to pay them to license the software on Windows OS. Wow, that makes me sound old. Working on royalties for optical drives on computers. Safe to say no one even thinks about optical drives anymore. 

It wasn't the prettiest work, but it helped me learn the basics of closing the books each month and forecasting the future each quarter. I had to submit journal entries and make manual adjustments to our payments when needed. Once you got the hang of pulling the data and making journal entries, the work wasn't all that hard. So most of my time toward the end of the rotation was spent trying to automate every single part of the ROB process. What was initially a complex refresh process handed to me was transformed into a simple click to refresh excel that did all of the heavy lifting for you. It was my pride and joy. 

My manager gave me a powerful piece of feedback. He said that I liked building things. Some people like to start things, others like to keep a process going or optimize it. I was someone who liked to build new things. That idea stuck with me. I eventually became the guy on the team who could build any complex workflow as a model in excel. For example building out the new forecast consolidation file that all team members could add their component forecasts into. While it was fun to build this kind of stuff, it wasn't AI work. For that I had to continue on my data hero's journey. 

### Second Rotation: Worldwide Commercial Solutions Finance

For my second rotation I wanted to leave the world of ROB behind and get my hands dirty with data. I went to a team that technically did two things. First was analytics around discounts and customer renewals across Microsoft's commercial business, and the second was around supporting the financing of customer purchases. Back in the day a customer could finance a large software purchase so they didn't have to pay for most of it up front. We would partner with a bank or finance the payment or even do the financing ourselves. 

This rotation was all around analytics, which was exactly what I needed. I was able to analyze patterns around the type of discounts we give to customers, and how those discounts compound as a customer continues to renew their software purchase contracts. Another big ticket analytics item was around tracking special azure financing deals. This was a key metric we reported directly to the CFO, so a lot of eye balls were on it. I was the guy to track down this data and create interesting ways to understand it. 

Power BI was recently released. No one on the team knew how to use it, but understood how powerful it could be when visualizing data. So I became the Power BI guy on the team. The one to figure out how to use it, then teach it to everyone else. Thankfully the previous FRP started them on the Power BI journey by building some initial dashboards. My job was to improve those dashboards, then get everyone else up to speed on how they could build their own. It was a solid experience in the world of analytics. One where no one could show you how to solve certain problems. You were on your own and had to figure everything out yourself. 

The analytics experience was great, but still no AI. While on the team I tried to find ways we could apply AI and machine learning to specific areas but couldn't find a good opportunity. At this point I started to learn
