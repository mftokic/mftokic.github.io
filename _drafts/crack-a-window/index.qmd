1. What am I trying to say? 
- Breathing stale air creates high levels of C02, and high C02 makes us dumb. 
2. What story can I tell? 
- Measuring the levels of C02 at my place (especially after I work out), at work, and at my girlfriends apartment with pets
- Why we feel like shit on planes
3. List major parts by sections/points
- Intro/hook
- How high C02 affects the body
- Measuring C02
    - Devices to use
    - What levels cause what affects
- Reducing C02
- Final Thoughts
4. Brain dump into each one
5. Refine into a cohesive narrative
6. Create hook/intro 
7. How is this 1% better than my previous post? 
8. Is this interesting? Is it fun to read? 
9. Final review, read it out loud via AI
10. Create thumbnail, make it fun

### Intro/hook

The more you breathe in a closed room, the dumber you get. This is caused by rising levels of CO2 in the air. This is why you feel like death on long plane rides, marathon conference room sessions, or spending all day inside a stuffy convention hall. High levels of CO2 contribute to poorer decision making, focus, and make you sleepy. All things we don't want when trying to get stuff done. Ever feel sleepy in the afternoon at your desk? It could just be rising C02 levels in your office. Why do you think the phrase, "go outside for some fresh air", actually exists? 

Let's crack a window, let some air in, and dive deeper into what's going on. 

### How high C02 affects the body

High levels of CO2 is usually caused by too many living beings breathing inside of a poorly ventilated space for an extended period of time. As we breathe oxygen in, we breathe out CO2. Things like plants cannot clean up that CO2 fast enough, so levels rise. 

Outdoor air has around 400ppm (parts per million). That's the healthy baseline we always want come close to with our indoor air. As the levels rise, our body's begin to suffer. 

- **400ppm**: Equivalent to outdoor error. 
- **400-800ppm**: Little to no expected cognitive impact. This is the sweet spot for most indoor spaces. 
- **800-1,000ppm**: Mild drowsiness and reduced mental sharpness start to occur. 
- **1,000-1,500**: 15-20% reduction in cognitive function. Symptoms like headache, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating continue to worsen. 
- **1,500-2,500**: Concentration and fatigue worsen, creative thinking drops off a cliff. 
- **2,500-5,000**: Cognitive performance falls by over 50%.
- **5,000+**: Hazardous level, not healthy for any amount of time.
