1. What am I trying to say?

- How cross validation allows us to actually back test a model properly. 
- Why time series needs a special set of cross-validation

2. What story can I tell? 
3. List major parts by sections/points
4. Brain dump into each one
5. Refine into a cohesive narrative
6. Create hook/intro 
7. How is this 1% better than my previous post? 
8. Is this interesting? Is it fun to read? 
9. Final review, read it out loud via AI
10. Create thumbnail, make it fun
11. Post blog 
12. Condense and post on LinkedIn
13. Condense and post on X

### Intro/Hook 

*This post is part of the [model evaluation chapter](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2025-05-13-ts-fundamentals-model-evaluation/) within a larger learning series around time series forecasting fundamentals. [Check out the main learning path](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2024-09-25-ts-fundamentals/) to see other posts in the series.* 

*The example monthly data used in this series [can be found here.](https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/posts/2024-10-02-ts-fundamentals-whats-a-time-series/example_ts_data.csv) You can also find the [python code used in this post here.](https://github.com/mftokic/mftokic.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/2026-01-29-ts-fundamentals-model-evaluation-train-test-split.ipynb)*

In the [previous post](https://mftokic.github.io/posts/2026-01-29-ts-fundamentals-model-evaluation-train-test/), we discussed the importance of splitting you data into train/test splits. This allows us to see how a model does on new data it hasn't seen before.
